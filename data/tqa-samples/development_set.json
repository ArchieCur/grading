      "topic_T_0793": "Stress is the force applied to a rock. There are four types of stresses: Confining stress happens as weight of all the overlying rock pushes down on a deeply buried rock. The rock is being pushed in from all sides, which compresses it. The rock will not deform because there is no place for it to move. Compression stress squeezes rocks together. Compression causes rocks to fold or fracture (Figure 7.1). When two cars collide, compression causes them to crumple. Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries. Tension stress pulls rocks apart. Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress found at divergent plate boundaries. Shear stress happens when forces slide past each other in opposite directions (Figure 7.2). This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries. The amount of stress on a rock may be greater than the rocks strength. In that case, the rock will change and deform (Figure 7.3). Deep within the Earth, the pressure is very great. A rock behaves like a stretched rubber band. When the stress stops, the rock goes back to its original shape. If more stress is applied to the rock, it bends and flows. It does not return to its original shape. Near the surface, if the stress continues, the rock will fracture and break. ",
      "topic_T_0794": "Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers. This is magnificently displayed around the southwestern United States. The arid climate allows rock layers to be well exposed (Figure 7.4). The lowest layers are the oldest and the higher layers are younger. Folds, joints and faults are caused by stresses. Figure 7.5 shows joints in a granite hillside. If a sedimentary rock is tilted or folded, we know that stresses have changed the rock (Figure 7.6). ",
      "topic_T_0795": "Deep within the Earth, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds. You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers. In the Figure 7.6, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are folded, they do not return to their original shape. There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines. A monocline is a simple one step bend in the rock layers (Figure 7.7). In a monocline, the oldest rocks are still at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold (Figure 7.8). The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center. A syncline is a fold that bends downward (Figure 7.9). In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center. The oldest rocks are at the outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin. If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin. ",
      "topic_T_0796": "With enough stress, a rock will fracture, or break. The fracture is called a joint if the rock breaks but doesnt move, as shown in Figure 7.10. If the rocks on one or both sides of a fracture move, the fracture is called a fault (Figure 7.11). Faults can occur alone or in clusters, creating a fault zone. Earthquakes happen when rocks break and move suddenly. The energy released causes an earthquake. Slip is the distance rocks move along a fault, as one block of rock moves past the other. The angle of a fault is called When compression squeezes the crust into a smaller space, the hanging wall pushes up relative to the footwall. This creates a reverse fault. A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault where the angle is nearly horizontal. Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults (Figure 7.13). ",
      "topic_T_0797": "A strike-slip fault is a dip-slip fault where the dip of the fault plane is vertical. Strike-slip faults result from shear stresses. If you stand with one foot on each side of a strike-slip fault, one side will be moving toward you while the other side moves away from you. If your right foot moves toward you, the fault is known as a right-lateral strike-slip fault. If your left foot moves toward you, the fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault (Figure 7.14). ",
      "topic_T_0798": "The San Andreas Fault in California is a right-lateral strike-slip fault (Figure 7.15). It is also a transform fault because the San Andreas is a plate boundary. As you can see, California will not fall into the ocean someday. The land west of the San Andreas Fault is moving northeastward, while the North American plate moves southwest. Someday, millions of years from now, Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco! ",
      "topic_T_0799": "Many processes create mountains. Most mountains form along plate boundaries. A few mountains may form in the middle of a plate. For example, huge volcanoes are mountains formed at hotspots within the Pacific Plate. ",
      "topic_T_0800": "Most of the worlds largest mountains form as plates collide at convergent plate boundaries. Continents are too buoyant to get pushed down into the mantle. So when the plates smash together, the crust crumples upwards. This creates mountains. Folding and faulting in these collision zones makes the crust thicker. The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India collides with Eurasia. About 80 million years ago, India was separated from Eurasia by an ocean (Figure 7.16). As the plates collided, pieces of the old seafloor were forced over the Asian continent. This old seafloor is now found high in the Himalayas (Figure 7.17). ",
      "topic_T_0801": "Volcanic mountain ranges form when oceanic crust is pushed down into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries. The Andes Mountains are a chain of coastal volcanic mountains. They are forming as the Nazca plate subducts beneath the South American plate (Figure 7.18). ",
      "topic_T_0802": "Mid-ocean ridges form at divergent plate boundaries. As the ocean floor separates an enormous line of volcanoes is created. When continental crust is pulled apart, it breaks into blocks. These blocks of crust are separated by normal faults. The blocks slide up or down. The result is alternating mountain ranges and valleys. This topography is known as basin-and-range (Figure 7.19). The area near Death Valley, California is the center of a classic basin-and-range province (Figure 7.20). ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "5. What happens when a rock deforms plastically? For how long does this happen? What factors should be considered when answering that last question? 6. Why is California know for having so many large earthquakes? 7. Imagine that you find a sequence of rock layers with the older rocks at the top and the younger rocks at the bottom. How could this have happened? ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "When plates collide, move apart, and slide past each other, lots of things happen. Nearly all earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building happens at plate boundaries. When plates are pushed or pulled, the rock is subjected to stress. Stress can cause a rock to change shape or to break. When a rock bends without breaking, it folds. When the rock breaks, it fractures. Mountain building and earthquakes are some of the responses rocks have to stress. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "List the different types of stresses that change rock.\nCompare the different types of folds and the conditions under which they form.\nCompare fractures and faults and define how they are related to earthquakes.\nCompare how mountains form and at what types of plate boundaries.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Stress is the force applied to a rock, which can cause the rock to change. The three main types of stress go along with the three types of plate boundaries. Compression is common at convergent boundaries, tension at divergent boundaries, and shear at transform boundaries. Rocks can bend and fold. Rocks can also fracture and break. Movement along a fracture produces a fault. The two main types of faults are dip-slip and strike-slip. In dip-slip faults, the angle of the fault plane is at an angle. In strike-slip faults, the fault plane is vertical. The worlds largest mountains grow at convergent plate boundaries, primarily by thrust faulting and folding. ",
      "adjunct_Points to Consider": "Think about stresses in the ocean basins. Where in the ocean basins are plates pulling apart? Where do plates come together? Earthquakes are primarily the result of plate tectonic motions. What type of stress would cause earthquakes at each of the three types of plate boundaries? Which type of plate boundary do you think has the most dangerous earthquakes? How do earthquakes cause the greatest damage? ",

      "topic_T_0170": "Most ocean waves are caused by winds. A wave is the transfer of energy through matter. A wave that travels across miles of ocean is traveling energy, not water. Ocean waves transfer energy from wind through water. The energy of a wave may travel for thousands of miles. The water itself moves very little. Figure 14.9 shows how water molecules move when a wave goes by. ",
      "topic_T_0171": "Figure 14.9 also shows how the size of waves is measured. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days. ",
      "topic_T_0172": "Figure 14.10 shows what happens to waves near shore. As waves move into shallow water, they start to touch the bottom. The base of the waves drag and slow. Soon the waves slow down and pile up. They get steeper and unstable as the top moves faster than the base. When they reach the shore, the waves topple over and break. ",
      "topic_T_0173": "Not all waves are caused by winds. A shock to the ocean can also send waves through water. A tsunami is a wave or set of waves that is usually caused by an earthquake. As we have seen in recent years, the waves can be enormous and extremely destructive. Usually tsunami waves travel through the ocean unnoticed. But when they reach the shore they become enormous. Tsunami waves can flood entire regions. They destroy property and cause many deaths. Figure 14.11 shows the damage caused by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004. ",
      "topic_T_0174": "Tides are daily changes in the level of ocean water. They occur all around the globe. High tides occur when the water reaches its highest level in a day. Low tides occur when the water reaches its lowest level in a day. Tides keep cycling from high to low and back again. In most places the water level rises and falls twice a day. So there are two high tides and two low tides approximately every 24 hours. In Figure 14.12, you can see the difference between high and low tides. This is called the tidal range. ",
      "topic_T_0175": "Figure 14.13 shows why tides occur. The main cause of tides is the pull of the Moons gravity on Earth. The pull is greatest on whatever is closest to the Moon. Although the gravity pulls the land, only the water can move. As a result: Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon is pulled hardest by the Moons gravity. This causes a bulge of water on that side of Earth. That bulge is a high tide. Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moons gravity than is the ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon. As a result, there is bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth. This creates another high tide. With water bulging on two sides of Earth, theres less water left in between. This creates low tides on the other two sides of the planet. ",
      "topic_T_0176": "The Suns gravity also pulls on Earth and its oceans. Even though the Sun is much larger than the Moon, the pull of the Suns gravity is much less because the Sun is much farther away. The Suns gravity strengthens or weakens the Moons influence on tides. Figure 14.14 shows the position of the Moon relative to the Sun at different times during the month. The positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other determines how the Sun affects tides. This creates spring tides or neap tides. Spring tides occur during the new moon and full moon. The Sun and Moon are in a straight line either on the same side of Earth or on opposite sides. Their gravitational pull combines to cause very high and very low tides. Spring tides have the greatest tidal range. Neap tides occur during the first and third quarters of the Moon. The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other. Their gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and lows are not as great. Neap tides have the smallest tidal range. This animation shows the effect of the Moon and Sun on the tides: ",
      "topic_T_0177": "Another way ocean water moves is in currents. A current is a stream of moving water that flows through the ocean. Surface currents are caused mainly by winds, but not the winds that blow and change each day. Surface currents are caused by the major wind belts that blow in the same direction all the time. The major surface currents are shown in Figure 14.15. They flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemi- sphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, they flow in the opposite direction. ",
      "topic_T_0178": "Winds and surface currents tend to move from the hot equator north or south toward the much cooler poles. Thats because of differences in the temperature of air masses over Earths surface. But Earth is spinning on its axis underneath the wind and water as they move. The Earth rotates from west to east. As a result, winds and currents actually end up moving toward the northeast or southeast. This effect of Earths rotation on the direction of winds and currents is called the Coriolis effect. ",
      "topic_T_0179": "Large ocean currents can have a big impact on the climate of nearby coasts. The Gulf Stream, for example, carries warm water from near the equator up the eastern coast of North America. Look at the map in Figure 14.16. It shows how the Gulf Stream warms both the water and land along the coast. ",
      "topic_T_0180": "Currents also flow deep below the surface of the ocean. Deep currents are caused by differences in density at the top and bottom. Density is defined as the amount of mass per unit of volume. More dense water takes up less space than less dense water. It has the same mass but less volume. Water that is more dense sinks. Less dense water rises. What can make water more dense? Water becomes more dense when it is colder and when it has more salt. In the North Atlantic Ocean, cold winds chill the water at the surface. Sea ice grows in this cold water, but ice is created from fresh water. The salt is left behind in the seawater. This cold, salty water is very dense, so it sinks to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Downwelling can take place in other places where surface water becomes very dense (see Figure 14.17). When water sinks it pushes deep water along at the bottom of the ocean. This water circulates through all of the ocean basins in deep currents. ",
      "topic_T_0181": "Sometimes deep ocean water rises to the surface. This is called upwelling. Figure 14.18 shows why it happens. Strong winds blow surface water away from shore. This allows deeper water to flow to the surface and take its place. When water comes up from the deep, it brings a lot of nutrients with it. Why is deep water so full of nutrients? Over time, dead organisms and other organic matter settle to the bottom water and collect. The nutrient-rich water that comes to the surface by upwelling supports many living things. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "6. The crest of an ocean wave is 3 meters above the still water level. The trough is 3 meters below the still water level. The horizontal distance between the crest and trough is 8 meters. Draw a diagram of this wave. Label the crest, trough, and distances. Then calculate the waves amplitude and wavelength. 7. Assume that a spring tide occurs on September 1. Predict when the next neap tide will occur. When will the next spring tide occur? Explain your answers. ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "If youve ever visited an ocean shore, then you know that ocean water is always moving. Waves ripple through the water, as shown in Figure 14.8. The water slowly rises and falls because of tides. You may see signs warning of currents that flow close to shore. What causes all these ocean motions? Different types of motions have different causes. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "Describe how waves move through water.\nExplain what causes tides.\nGive an overview of surface currents.\nIdentify the cause of deep currents.\nDescribe upwelling.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Most ocean waves are caused by winds. The size of a wave depends on how fast, how far, and how long the wind blows. Tsunamis are waves caused by earthquakes. Tides are daily changes in the level of ocean water. They are caused mainly by the pull of the Moons gravity on Earth and its oceans. The Suns gravity also influences tides. Surface currents are like streams flowing through the surface of the ocean. They are caused mainly by winds. Earths rotation influences their direction. This is called the Coriolis effect. Surface currents may affect the climate of nearby coasts. Deep currents are convection currents that occur far below the surface. They are caused by differences in the density of ocean water. Upwelling occurs when deep ocean water rises to the surface. The water brings nutrients with it. These nutrients support many organisms. ",
      "adjunct_Points to Consider": "Upwelling brings nutrients to the surface from the ocean floor. Nutrients are important resources for ocean life. However, they arent the only resources on the ocean floor. What other resources do you think might be found on the ocean floor? Its hard to get resources from the ocean floor. Can you explain why?

Are deep currents the same as surface currents except that they are near the ocean bottom? "

      "topic_T_2407": "The chemical elements and water that are needed by living things keep recycling on Earth. They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. An exchange pool is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. ",
      "topic_T_2408": "Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. Watch this video for an excellent visual introduction to the water cycle:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: ",
      "topic_T_2409": "Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. ",
      "topic_T_2410": "Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water. ",
      "topic_T_2411": "Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land soaks into the ground. This water becomes groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater is taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that stores water. Water may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years. ",
      "topic_T_2412": "The element carbon is the basis of all life on Earth. Biochemical compounds consist of chains of carbon atoms and just a few other elements. Like water, carbon is constantly recycled through the biotic and abiotic factors of ecosystems. The carbon cycle includes carbon in sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels under the ground, the ocean, the atmosphere, and living things. The diagram in Figure 24.9 represents the carbon cycle. It shows some of the ways that carbon moves between the different parts of the cycle. You can see an animated carbon cycle at this link: http://commons.w ",
      "topic_T_2413": "Major reservoirs of carbon include sedimentary rocks, fossil fuels, and the ocean. Sediments from dead organisms may form carbon-containing sedimentary rocks. Alternatively, the sediments may form carbon-rich fossil fuels, which include oil, natural gas, and coal. Carbon can be stored in these reservoirs for millions of years. However, if fossil fuels are extracted and burned, the stored carbon enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, can also release underground carbon from rocks into the atmosphere. Water erosion by runoff, rivers, and streams dissolves carbon in rocks and carries it to the ocean. Ocean water near the surface dissolves carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Dissolved carbon may be stored in the deep ocean for thousands of years. ",
      "topic_T_2414": "Major exchange pools of carbon include organisms and the atmosphere. Carbon cycles more quickly between these components of the carbon cycle. Photosynthesis by plants and other producers removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make organic compounds for living things. Cellular respiration by living things releases carbon into the atmosphere or ocean as carbon dioxide. Decomposition of dead organisms and organic wastes releases carbon back to the atmosphere, soil, or ocean. ",
      "topic_T_2415": "Nitrogen is another common element found in living things. It is needed to form both proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. Nitrogen gas makes up 78 percent of Earths atmosphere. In the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen flows back and forth between the atmosphere and living things. You can see how it happens in Figure 24.10. Several different types of bacteria play major roles in the cycle. Animals get nitrogen by eating plants or other organisms that eat plants. Where do plants get nitrogen? They cant use nitrogen gas in the air. The only form of nitrogen that plants can use is in chemical compounds called nitrates. Plants absorb nitrates through their roots. This is called assimilation. Most of the nitrates are produced by bacteria that live in soil or in the roots of plants called legumes. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to nitrates in soil. When organisms die and decompose, their nitrogen is returned to the soil as ammonium ions. Nitrifying bacteria change some of the ammonium ions into nitrates. The other ammonium ions are changed into nitrogen gas by denitrifying bacteria. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "5. A farmer may plant a field with a legume crop to improve the soil. How does this work? ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells? What is the source of the carbon and nitrogen that are needed to make your organic molecules? These forms of matter are recycled in an ecosystem. Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem. It just keeps cycling. ",

      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Water and chemical elements that organisms need keep recycling through biogeochemical cycles. These cycles include biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. The water cycle includes the ocean, atmosphere, ground, and living things. During the water cycle, water keeps changing state by processes such as evaporation, transpiration, condensation, and precipitation. The carbon cycle includes photosynthesis, in which plants change carbon dioxide to organic compounds. It also includes cellular respiration, in which living things burn organic compounds and release carbon dioxide. Rocks, fossil fuels, and the ocean are also part of the carbon cycle. Bacteria play important roles in the nitrogen cycle. They change nitrogen gas and products of decomposition into nitrates, which plants can assimilate. Animals obtain nitrogen by eating plants or other organisms. Still other bacteria return nitrogen gas to the atmosphere. ",

For a good video introduction to the heart and how it works, watch this entertaining Bill Nye video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: ",
      "topic_T_2194": "The heart has four chambers, or rooms, which you can see in Figure 18.3. Each chamber is an empty space with muscular walls through which blood can flow. The top two chambers of the heart are called the left and right atria (atrium, singular). The atria of the heart receive blood from the body or lungs and pump it into the bottom chambers of the heart. The bottom two chambers of the heart are called the left and right ventricles. The ventricles receive blood from the atria and pump it out of the heart, either to the lungs or to the rest of the body. Flaps of tissue called valves separate the hearts chambers. Valves keep blood flowing in just one direction through the heart. For example, a valve at the bottom of the right atrium opens to let blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Then the valve closes so the blood cant flow back into the right atrium. ",
      "topic_T_2195": "Blood flows through the heart in two paths. Trace these two paths in Figure 18.4 as you read about them below. You can also learn about how blood flows through the heart with this rap:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  1. One path of blood in the heart is through the right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium receives oxygen- poor blood from the body. It pumps the blood into the right ventricle. Then the right ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart to the lungs. This path through the heart is part of the pulmonary circulation. 2. The other path of blood in the heart is through the left atrium and left ventricle. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. It pumps the blood into the left ventricle. Then the left ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. This path through the heart is part of the systemic circulation. ",
      "topic_T_2196": "To move blood through the heart, cardiac muscles must contract in a certain sequence. First the atria must contract, followed quickly by the ventricles contracting. This series of contractions keeps blood moving continuously through the heart. Contractions of cardiac muscles arent under voluntary control. They are controlled by a cluster of special cells within the heart, commonly called the pacemaker. These cells send electrical signals to cardiac muscles so they contract in the correct sequence and with just the right timing. ",
      "topic_T_2197": "Blood vessels are long, tube-like organs that consist mainly of muscle, connective, and epithelial tissues. They branch to form a complex network of vessels that run throughout the body. This network transports blood to all the bodys cells. ",
      "topic_T_2198": "There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. You can see each type in Figure 18.5. You can watch a good video introduction to the three types at this link:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Arteries are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of blood pumped by the heart. Arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood. The largest artery is the aorta, which receives blood directly from the heart. It branches to form smaller and smaller arteries throughout the body. The smallest arteries are called arterioles. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. This blood is no longer under pressure, so veins have thinner walls. To keep the blood moving, many veins have valves that prevent the backflow of blood. Veins generally carry oxygen-poor blood. The smallest veins are called venules. They merge to form larger and larger veins. The largest vein is the inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower body directly to the heart. Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessels. They connect the smallest arteries (arterioles) and veins (venules). Exchange of substances between cells and the blood takes place across the walls of capillaries, which may be only one cell thick. ",
      "topic_T_2199": "Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either dilating (widening) or constricting (narrowing). This changes the amount of blood flowing to particular organs. For example, dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more blood to flow to the surface of the body. This helps the body lose excess heat. Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps the body conserve heat. ",

      "topic_T_2201": "Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases. The leading cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a material called plaque builds up inside arteries. Plaque consists of cell debris, cholesterol, and other substances. As plaque builds up in an artery, the artery narrows, as shown in Figure If plaque blocks coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, coronary heart disease results. Poor blood flow to the heart may cause chest pain or a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is completely blocked so that cardiac muscle cells die. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in U.S adults. ",
      "topic_T_2202": "Many factors influence your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Some of these factors you cant control. Older age, male gender, and a family history of cardiovascular disease all increase the risk and cant be controlled. However, you can control many other factors.

      "topic_T_1994": "Flatworms have a flat body because they lack a fluid-filled body cavity. They also have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. However, flatworms represent several evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have the following adaptations: Flatworms have three embryonic cell layers. They have a mesoderm layer in addition to ectoderm and endoderm layers. The mesoderm layer allows flatworms to develop muscle tissues so they can move easily over solid surfaces. Flatworms have a concentration of nerve tissue in the head end. This was a major step in the evolution of a brain. It was also needed for bilateral symmetry. Flatworms have bilateral symmetry. This gives them a better sense of direction than radial symmetry would.

Then the life cycle repeats. ",
      "topic_T_1996": "Some flatworms live in water or moist soil. They eat invertebrates and decaying animals. Other flatworms, such as tapeworms, are parasites that live inside vertebrate hosts. Usually, more than one type of host is needed to complete the parasites life cycle, as shown in Figure 12.12. ",
      "topic_T_1997": "Roundworms are invertebrates in Phylum Nematoda. This is a very diverse phylum. It has more than 80,000 known species. Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters in length. You can see an example of a roundworm in Figure 12.13. ",
      "topic_T_1998": "Roundworms have a round body because they have a partial fluid-filled body cavity (pseudocoelom). This is one way that roundworms differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to eat, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time. Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in their partial body cavity. The fluid pressure adds stiffness to the body. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles, allowing roundworms to move easily over surfaces. ",
      "topic_T_1999": "Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the life cycle repeats. ",
      "topic_T_2000": "Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic organisms. Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in moist soil. They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or decaying organic matter. By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Parasitic roundworms may have plant, invertebrate, or vertebrate hosts. Several roundworm species infect humans. Besides ascaris, they include hookworms. Hookworms are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the hosts intestines. You can see the hooks in Figure 12.14. Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Female adults lay large quantities of eggs. Eggs pass out of the host in feces. Eggs hatch into larvae in the feces or soil.

Heat and/or pressure then change the rocks physical or chemical makeup. During metamorphism a rock may change chemically. Ions move and new minerals form. The new minerals are more stable in the new environment. Extreme pressure may lead to physical changes like foliation. Foliation forms as the rocks are squeezed. If pressure is exerted from one direction, the rock forms layers. This is foliation. If pressure is exerted from all directions, the rock usually does not show foliation. There are two main types of metamorphism: 1. Contact metamorphism results when magma contacts a rock, changing it by extreme heat (Figure 4.14). 2. Regional metamorphism occurs over a wide area. Great masses of rock are exposed to pressure from rock and sediment layers on top of it. The rock may also be compressed by other geological processes. Metamorphism does not cause a rock to melt completely. It only causes the minerals to change by heat or pressure. Hornfels is a rock with alternating bands of dark and light crystals. Hornfels is a good example of how minerals rearrange themselves during metamorphism (Figure 4.14). The minerals in hornfels separate by density. The result is that the rock becomes banded.

When it is visible, it is the brightest object in the night sky besides the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is quite far from the Earth. The planet is more than five times as far from Earth as the Sun. It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit once around the Sun. ",

Scientists think that the ice may sit on top of an ocean of liquid water. How could Europa have liquid water when it is so far from the Sun? Europa is heated by Jupiter. Jupiters tidal forces are so great that they stretch and squash its moon. This could produce enough heat for there to be liquid water. Numerous missions have been planned to explore Europa, including plans to drill through the ice and send a probe into the ocean. However, no such mission has yet been attempted.

Thunder and lightning have been seen in the storms on Saturn (Figure 25.23). ",
      "topic_T_0586": "There is a strange feature at Saturns north pole. The clouds form a hexagonal pattern, as shown in the infrared image in Figure 25.24. This hexagon was viewed by Voyager 1 in the 1980s. It was still there when the Cassini Orbiter visited in 2006. No one is sure why the clouds form this pattern. ",
      "topic_T_0587": "Saturns rings were first observed by Galileo in 1610. He didnt know they were rings and thought that they were two large moons. One moon was on either side of the planet. In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens realized that they were rings circling Saturns equator. The rings appear tilted. This is because Saturn is tilted about 27 degrees to its side. The Voyager 1 spacecraft visited Saturn in 1980. Voyager 2 followed in 1981. These probes sent back detailed pictures of Saturn, its rings, and some of its moons. From the Voyager data, we learned that Saturns rings are made of particles of water and ice with a little bit of dust. There are several gaps in the rings. These gaps were cleared out by moons within the rings. Ring dust and gas are attracted to the moon by its gravity. This leaves a gap in the rings. Other gaps in the rings are caused by the competing forces of Saturn and its moons outside the rings. ",
      "topic_T_0588": "As of 2011, over 60 moons have been identified around Saturn. Only seven of Saturns moons are round. All but one is smaller than Earths Moon. Some of the very small moons are found within the rings. All the particles in the rings are like little moons, because they orbit around Saturn. Someone must decide which ones are large enough to call moons. Saturns largest moon, Titan, is about one and a half times the size of Earths Moon. Titan is even larger than the planet Mercury. Figure 25.25 compares the size of Titan to Earth. Scientists are very interested in Titan. The moon has an atmosphere that is thought to be like Earths first atmosphere. This atmosphere was around before life developed on Earth. Like Jupiters moon, Europa, Titan may have a layer of liquid water under a layer of ice. Scientists now think that there are lakes on Titans surface. Dont take a dip, though. These lakes contain liquid methane and ethane instead of water! Methane and ethane are compounds found in natural gas. ",
      "topic_T_0589": "Uranus, shown in Figure 25.26, is named for the Greek god of the sky, the father of Saturn. Astronomers pronounce the name YOOR-uh-nuhs. Uranus was not known to ancient observers. The planet was first discovered with a telescope by the astronomer William Herschel in 1781. Uranus is faint because it is very far away. Its distance from the Sun is 2.8 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles). A photon from the Sun takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus. Uranus orbits the Sun once about every 84 Earth years. ",
      "topic_T_0590": "Uranus is a lot like Jupiter and Saturn. The planet is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. There is a thick layer of gas on the outside. Further on the inside is liquid. But Uranus has a higher percentage of icy materials than Jupiter and Saturn. These materials include water, ammonia, and methane. Uranus is also different because of its blue-green color. Clouds of methane filter out red light. This leaves a blue-green color. The atmosphere of Uranus has bands of clouds. These clouds are hard to see in normal light. The result is that the planet looks like a plain blue ball. Uranus is the least massive outer planet. Its mass is only about 14 times the mass of Earth. Like all of the outer planets, Uranus is much less dense than Earth. Gravity is actually weaker than on Earths surface. If you were at the top of the clouds on Uranus, you would weigh about 10 percent less than what you weigh on Earth. ",
      "topic_T_0591": "All of the planets rotate on their axes in the same direction that they move around the Sun. Except for Uranus. Uranus is tilted on its side. Its axis is almost parallel to its orbit. So Uranus rolls along like a bowling ball as it revolves around the Sun. How did Uranus get this way? Scientists think that the planet was struck and knocked over by another planet-sized object. This collision probably took place billions of years ago. ",
      "topic_T_0592": "Uranus has a faint system of rings, as shown in Figure 25.27. The rings circle the planets equator. However, Uranus is tilted on its side. So the rings are almost perpendicular to the planets orbit. We have discovered 27 moons around Uranus. All but a few are named for characters from the plays of William Shakespeare. The five biggest moons of Uranus, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, are shown in Figure ",
      "topic_T_0593": "Neptune is shown in Figure 25.29. It is the eighth planet from the Sun. Neptune is so far away you need a telescope to see it from Earth. Neptune is the most distant planet in our solar system. It is nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun. One orbit around the Sun takes Neptune 165 Earth years. Scientists guessed Neptunes existence before it was discovered. Uranus did not always appear exactly where it should. They said this was because a planet beyond Uranus was pulling on it. This gravitational pull was affecting its orbit. Neptune was discovered in 1846. It was just where scientists predicted it would be! Due to its blue color, the planet was named Neptune for the Roman god of the sea. Uranus and Neptune are often considered sister planets. They are very similar to each other. Neptune has slightly more mass than Uranus, but it is slightly smaller in size. ",
      "topic_T_0594": "Like Uranus, Neptune is blue. The blue color is caused by gases in its atmosphere, including methane. Neptune is not a smooth looking ball like Uranus. The planet has a few darker and lighter spots. When Voyager 2 visited Neptune in 1986, there was a large dark-blue spot south of the equator. This spot was called the Great Dark Spot. When the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. Another dark spot had appeared north of the equator. Astronomers believe that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on Neptune. Neptunes appearance changes due to its turbulent atmosphere. Winds are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system. Wind speeds can reach 1,100 km/h (700 mph). This is close to the speed of sound! The rapid winds surprised astronomers. This is because Neptune receives little energy from the Sun to power weather systems. It is not surprising that Neptune is one of the coldest places in the solar system. Temperatures at the top of the clouds are about 218C (360F). ",
      "topic_T_0595": "Like the other outer planets, Neptune has rings of ice and dust. These rings are much thinner and fainter than Saturns. Neptunes rings may be unstable. They may change or disappear in a relatively short time. Neptune has 13 known moons. Only Triton, shown in Figure 25.30, has enough mass to be round. Triton orbits in the direction opposite to Neptunes orbit. Scientists think Triton did not form around Neptune. The satellite was captured by Neptunes gravity as it passed by. ",
      "topic_T_0596": "Pluto was once considered one of the outer planets, but when the definition of a planet was changed in 2006, Pluto became one of the dwarf planets. It is one of the largest and brightest objects that make up this group. Look for Pluto in the next lesson, in the discussion of dwarf planets. ",

      "adjunct_Introduction": "Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the outer planets of our solar system. These are the four planets farthest from the Sun. The outer planets are much larger than the inner planets. Since they are mostly made of gases, they are also called gas giants. The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium. These are the same elements that make up most of the Sun. Astronomers think that most of the nebula was hydrogen and helium. The inner planets lost these very light gases. Their gravity was too low to keep them and they floated away into space. The Sun and the outer planets had enough gravity to keep the hydrogen and helium. All of the outer planets have numerous moons. They also have planetary rings made of dust and other small particles. Only the rings of Saturn can be easily seen from Earth. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "Describe main features of the outer planets and their moons.\nCompare the outer planets to each other and to Earth.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "The four outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all gas giants made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Their thick outer layers are gases and have liquid interiors. All of the outer planets have lots of moons, as well as planetary rings made of dust and other particles. Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It has bands of different colored clouds, and a long-lasting storm called the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has over 60 moons. The four biggest were discovered by Galileo, and are called the Galilean moons. One of the Galilean moons, Europa, may have an ocean of liquid water under a layer of ice. The conditions in this ocean might be right for life to have developed. Saturn is smaller than Jupiter, but very similar to Jupiter. Saturn has a large system of beautiful rings. Saturns largest moon, Titan, has an atmosphere similar to Earths atmosphere before life formed. Uranus and Neptune were discovered using a telescope. They are similar to each other in size and composition. They are both smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, and also have more icy materials. Uranus is tilted on its side, probably due to a collision with a large object in the distant past. Neptune is very cold and has very strong winds. It had a large dark spot that disappeared. Another dark spot appeared on another part of the planet. These dark spots are storms in Neptunes atmosphere. ",
      "adjunct_Points to Consider": "The inner planets are small and rocky, while the outer planets are large and made of gases. Why might the planets have formed into these two groups? We have discussed the Sun, the planets, and the moons of the planets. What other objects can you think of that can be found in our solar system? ",

      "topic_T_3845": "The structure of the human eye is shown in Figure 22.24. Find each structure in the diagram as you read about it below. The cornea is the transparent outer covering of the eye. It protects the eye and also acts as a convex lens, helping to focus light that enters the eye. The pupil is an opening in the front of the eye. It looks black because it doesnt reflect any light. It allows light to enter the eye. The pupil automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed. The iris is the colored part of the eye. It controls the size of the pupil. The lens is a convex lens that fine-tunes the focus so an image forms on the back of the eye. Tiny muscles control the shape of the lens to focus images of close or distant objects. The retina is a membrane lining the back of the eye. The retina has nerve cells called rods and cones that change images to electrical signals. Rods are good at sensing dim light but cant distinguish different colors of light. Cones can sense colors but not in dim light. There are three different types of cones. Each type senses one of the three primary colors of light. The optic nerve carries electrical signals from the rods and cones to the brain. ",
      "topic_T_3846": "As just described, the eyes collect and focus visible light. The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus a real image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in Figure 22.25. The image reaches the brain as electrical signals that travel through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the signals as shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see is always right-side up. The brain also tells us what we are seeing. ",
      "topic_T_3847": "Many people have vision problems. The problems often can be corrected with contact lenses or lenses in eyeglasses. Some vision problems can also be corrected with laser surgery, which reshapes the cornea. Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and farsightedness. You may even have one of these conditions yourself. Both are illustrated in Figure 22.26 and in the video at this URL:  (1:08). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects are blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is longer than normal. This causes images to be focused in front of the retina. Myopia can be corrected with concave lenses. The lenses focus images farther back in the eye, so they are on the retina instead of in front of it. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects are blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal. This causes images to be focused in back of the retina. Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they are on the retina instead of behind it. ",

      "topic_T_0211": "Heat and light are forms of energy. Other forms are chemical and electrical energy. Energy cant be created or destroyed. It can change form. For example, a piece of wood has chemical energy stored in its molecules. When the wood burns, the chemical energy changes to heat and light energy. ",
      "topic_T_0212": "Energy can move from one place to another. It can travel through space or matter. Thats why you can feel the heat of a campfire and see its light. These forms of energy travel from the campfire to you. ",
      "topic_T_0213": "Almost all energy on Earth comes from the Sun. The Suns energy heats the planet and the air around it. Sunlight also powers photosynthesis and life on Earth. ",
      "topic_T_0214": "The Sun gives off energy in tiny packets called photons. Photons travel in waves. Figure 15.7 models a wave of light. Notice the wavelength in the figure. Waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy. ",
      "topic_T_0215": "Energy from the Sun has a wide range of wavelengths. The total range of energy is called the electromagnetic spectrum. You can see it in Figure 15.8. Visible light is the only light that humans can see. Different wavelengths of visible light appear as different colors. Radio waves have the longest wavelengths. They also have the least amount of energy. Infrared light has wavelengths too long for humans to see, but we can feel them as heat. The atmosphere absorbs the infrared light. Ultraviolet (UV) light is in wavelengths too short for humans to see. The most energetic UV light is harmful to life. The atmosphere absorbs most of this UV light from the Sun. Gamma rays have the highest energy and they are the most damaging rays. Fortunately, gamma rays dont penetrate Earths atmosphere. ",
      "topic_T_0216": "Energy travels through space or material. Heat energy is transferred in three ways: radiation, conduction, and convection. ",
      "topic_T_0217": "Radiation is the transfer of energy by waves. Energy can travel as waves through air or empty space. The Suns energy travels through space by radiation. After sunlight heats the planets surface, some heat radiates back into the atmosphere. ",
      "topic_T_0218": "In conduction, heat is transferred from molecule to molecule by contact. Warmer molecules vibrate faster than cooler ones. They bump into the cooler molecules. When they do they transfer some of their energy. Conduction happens mainly in the lower atmosphere. Can you explain why? ",
      "topic_T_0219": "Convection is the transfer of heat by a current. Convection happens in a liquid or a gas. Air near the ground is warmed by heat radiating from Earths surface. The warm air is less dense, so it rises. As it rises, it cools. The cool air is dense, so it sinks to the surface. This creates a convection current, like the one in Figure 15.9. Convection is the most important way that heat travels in the atmosphere. ",
      "topic_T_0220": "Different parts of Earths surface receive different amounts of sunlight. You can see this in Figure 15.10. The Suns rays strike Earths surface most directly at the equator. This focuses the rays on a small area. Near the poles, the Suns rays strike the surface at a slant. This spreads the rays over a wide area. The more focused the rays are, the more energy an area receives and the warmer it is. ",
      "topic_T_0221": "When sunlight heats Earths surface, some of the heat radiates back into the atmosphere. Some of this heat is absorbed by gases in the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse effect, and it helps to keep Earth warm. The greenhouse effect allows Earth to have temperatures that can support life. Gases that absorb heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. They include carbon dioxide and water vapor. Human actions have increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is shown in Figure 15.11. The added gases have caused a greater greenhouse effect. How do you think this affects Earths temperature? ",

Earth gets its energy from the Sun. The Sun gives off photons of energy that travel in waves. All the wavelengths of the Suns energy make up the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. Energy moves in three ways. By radiation, it travels in waves across space. By conduction, it moves between molecules that are in contact. By convection, it moves in a current through a liquid or gas. Energy from the Sun is more focused at the equator than the poles. Differences in energy by latitude cause winds and weather. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb heat. This is called the greenhouse effect and it makes the planet warmer. Human actions have increased the greenhouse effect. ",

Plankton make up one of three major groups of marine life. The other two groups are nekton and benthos. Figure 14.24 shows the three groups. ",
      "topic_T_0190": "Plankton are living things that float in the water. Most plankton are too small to see with the unaided eye. Some examples are shown in Figure 14.25. Plankton are unable to move on their own. Ocean motions carry them along. There are two main types of plankton: 1. Phytoplankton are plant-like plankton. They make food by photosynthesis. They live in the photic zone. Most are algae. 2. Zooplankton are animal-like plankton. They feed on phytoplankton. They include tiny animals and fish larvae. ",

Fish have fins and streamlined bodies to help them swim. Fish also have gills to take oxygen from the water. Figure 14.26 shows examples of nekton. ",
      "topic_T_0192": "Benthos are living things on the ocean floor. Many benthic organisms attach themselves to rocks and stay in one place. This protects them from crashing waves and other water movements. Some benthic organisms burrow into sediments for food or protection. Benthic animals may crawl over the ocean floor. Examples of benthos include clams and worms. Figure 14.27 shows two other examples. Some benthos live near vents on the deep ocean floor. Tubeworms are an example (see Figure 14.28). Scalding hot water pours out of the vents. The hot water contains chemicals that some specialized bacteria can use to make food. Tubeworms let the bacteria live inside them. The bacteria get protection and the tubeworms get some of the food. ",
      "topic_T_0193": "Figure 14.29 shows a marine food chain. Phytoplankton form the base of the food chain. Phytoplankton are the most important primary producers in the ocean. They use sunlight and nutrients to make food by photosynthesis. Small zooplankton consume phytoplankton. Larger organisms eat the small zooplankton. Larger predators eat these consumers. In an unusual relationship, some enormous whales depend on plankton for their food. They filter tremendous amounts of these tiny creatures out of the water. The bacteria that make food from chemicals are also primary producers. These organisms do not do photosynthesis since there is no light at the vents. They do something called chemosynthesis. They break down chemicals to make food. When marine organisms die, decomposers break them down. This returns their nutrients to the water. The nutrients can be used again to make food. Decomposers in the oceans include bacteria and worms. Many live on the ocean floor. Do you know why? ",

      "topic_T_0626": "Star clusters are groups of stars smaller than a galaxy. There are two main types, open clusters and globular clusters. Open clusters are groups of up to a few thousand stars held together by gravity. The Jewel Box, shown in Figure an open cluster are young stars that all formed from the same nebula. Globular clusters are groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars held tightly together by gravity. Globular clusters have a definite, spherical shape. They contain mostly old, reddish stars. Near the center of a globular cluster, the stars are closer together. Figure 26.7 shows a globular cluster. The heart of the globular cluster M13 has hundreds of thousands of stars. M13 is 145 light years in diameter. The cluster contains red and blue giant stars. ",
      "topic_T_0627": "The biggest groups of stars are called galaxies. A few million to many billions of stars may make up a galaxy. With the unaided eye, every star you can see is part of the Milky Way Galaxy. All the other galaxies are extremely far away. The closest spiral galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy, shown in Figure 26.8, is 2,500,000 light years away and contains one trillion stars! ",
      "topic_T_0628": "Galaxies are divided into three types, according to shape. There are spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. Spiral galaxies are a rotating disk of stars and dust. In the center is a dense bulge of material. Several arms spiral out from the center. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and many young stars. Figure 26.9 shows a spiral galaxy from the side. You can see the disk and central bulge. ",
      "topic_T_0629": "Figure 26.10 shows a typical elliptical galaxy. Elliptical galaxies are oval in shape. The smallest are called dwarf elliptical galaxies. Look back at the image of the Andromeda Galaxy. It has two dwarf elliptical galaxies as its companions. Dwarf galaxies are often found near larger galaxies. They sometimes collide with and merge into their larger neighbors. Giant elliptical galaxies contain over a trillion stars. Elliptical galaxies are red to yellow in color because they contain mostly old stars. Most contain very little gas and dust because the material has already formed into stars. ",
      "topic_T_0630": "Look at the galaxy in Figure 26.11. Do you think this is a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy? It doesnt look like either! If a galaxy is not spiral or elliptical, it is an irregular galaxy. Most irregular galaxies have been deformed. This can occur either by the pull of a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy. ",
      "topic_T_0631": "If you get away from city lights and look up in the sky on a very clear night, you will see something spectacular. A band of milky light stretches across the sky, as in Figure 26.12. This band is the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. This is the galaxy where we all live. The Milky Way Galaxy looks different to us than other galaxies because our view is from inside of it! ",
      "topic_T_0632": "The Milky Way Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that contains about 400 billion stars. Like other spiral galaxies, it has a disk, a central bulge, and spiral arms. The disk is about 100,000 light-years across. It is about 3,000 light years thick. Most of the galaxys gas, dust, young stars, and open clusters are in the disk. Some astronomers think that there is a gigantic black hole at the center of the galaxy. Figure 26.13 shows what the Milky Way probably looks like from the outside. Our solar system is within one of the spiral arms. Most of the stars we see in the sky are relatively nearby stars that are also in this spiral arm. We are a little more than halfway out from the center of the Galaxy to the edge, as shown in Figure 26.13. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy as the galaxy spins. One orbit of the solar system takes about 225 to 250 million years. The solar system has orbited 20 to 25 times since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. ",

      "adjunct_Introduction": "Compared to Earth, the solar system is a big place. But galaxies are bigger - a lot bigger. A galaxy is a very large group of stars held together by gravity. How enormous a galaxy is and how many stars it contains are impossible for us to really understand. A galaxy contains up to a few billion stars! Our solar system is in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is so large that if our solar system were the size of your fist, the galaxys disk would be wider than the entire United States! There are several different types of galaxies, and there are billions of galaxies in the universe. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "Identify different types of galaxies.\nDescribe our own galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Open clusters are groups of young stars loosely held together by gravity. Globular clusters are spherical groups of old stars held tightly together by gravity. Galaxies are collections of millions to many billions of stars. Spiral galaxies have a rotating disk of stars and dust, a bulge in the middle, and several arms spiraling out from the center. The disk and arms contain many young, blue stars. Typical elliptical galaxies are oval shaped, red or yellow, and contain mostly old stars. A galaxy that is not elliptical or spiral is an irregular galaxy. These galaxies were deformed by other galaxies. The band of light called the Milky Way is the disk of our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, which is a typical spiral galaxy. Our solar system is in a spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, a little more than halfway from the center to the edge of the disk. Most of the stars we see are in our spiral arm. ",

      "topic_T_1867": "Water is unevenly distributed around the world. Large portions of the world, such as much of northern Africa, receive very little water relative to their population (Figure 1.1). The map shows the number of months in which there is little rainfall in each region. In developed nations, water is stored, but in underdeveloped nations, water storage may be minimal. Over time, as population grows, rainfall totals will change, resulting in less water per person in some regions. In 2025, many nations, even developed nations, are projected to have less water per person than now ",
      "topic_T_1868": "Water scarcity is a problem now and will become an even larger problem in the future as water sources are reduced or polluted and population grows. In 1995, about 40% of the worlds population faced water scarcity. Scientists estimate that by the year 2025, nearly half of the worlds people wont have enough water to meet their daily needs. Nearly one-quarter of the worlds people will have less than 500 m3 of water to use in an entire year. That amount is less water in a year than some people in the United States use in one day. Some regions have very little rainfall per month. ",
      "topic_T_1869": "Droughts occur when a region experiences unusually low precipitation for months or years (Figure 1.2). Periods of drought may create or worsen water shortages. Human activities can contribute to the frequency and duration of droughts. For example, deforestation keeps trees from returning water to the atmosphere by transpiration; part of the water cycle becomes broken. Because it is difficult to predict when droughts will happen, it is difficult for countries to predict how serious water shortages will be each year. Extended periods with lower than normal rainfall cause droughts. ",
      "topic_T_1870": "Global warming will change patterns of rainfall and water distribution. As the Earth warms, regions that currently receive an adequate supply of rain may shift. Regions that rely on snowmelt may find that there is less snow and the melt comes earlier and faster in the spring, causing the water to run off and not be available through the dry summers. A change in temperature and precipitation would completely change the types of plants and animals that can live successfully in that region. ",
      "topic_T_1871": "Water scarcity can have dire consequences for the people, the economy, and the environment. Without adequate water, crops and livestock dwindle and people go hungry. Industry, construction, and economic development is halted, causing a nation to sink further into poverty. The risk of regional conflicts over scarce water resources rises. People die from diseases, thirst, or even in war over scarce resources. Californias population is growing by hundreds of thousands of people a year, but much of the state receives as much annual rainfall as Morocco. With fish populations crashing, global warming, and the demands of the countrys largest agricultural industry, the pressures on our water supply are increasing.

      "topic_T_1872": "As water supplies become scarce, conflicts will arise between the individuals or nations that have enough clean water and those that do not (Figure 1.3). Some of todays greatest tensions are happening in places where water is scarce. Water disputes may add to tensions between countries where differing national interests and withdrawal rights have been in conflict. Just as with energy resources today, wars may erupt over water. Water disputes are happening along 260 different river systems that cross national boundaries. Some of these disputes are potentially very serious. International water laws, such as the Helsinki Rules, help interpret water rights among countries. Many regions already experience water scarcity. This map shows the number of months in which the amount of water that is used exceeds the availability of water that can be used sustainably. This is projected to get worse as demand increases. ",

      "adjunct_Summary": "A lot of the problem with water is that it is not evenly distributed across the planet. Many of the worlds people live with water scarcity, and that percentage will increase as populations increase and climate changes. Some people predict that, just as wars are fought over energy now, future wars will be fought over water. "

      "topic_T_2127": "From the outside, the skin looks plain and simple, as you can see in Figure 16.5. But at a cellular level, theres nothing plain or simple about it. A single square inch of skin contains about 20 blood vessels, hundreds of sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings. It also contains tens of thousands of pigment-producing cells. Clearly, there is much more to skin than meets the eye! For a dramatic introduction to the skin, watch this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The skin is only about 2 mm thick, or about as thick as the cover of a book. Although it is very thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called the epidermis and the dermis. You can see both layers and some of their structures in Figure 16.6. Refer to the figure as you read about the epidermis and dermis below. ",
      "topic_T_2128": "The epidermis is the outer layer of skin. It consists almost entirely of epithelial cells. There are no blood vessels, nerve endings, or glands in this skin layer. Nonetheless, this layer of skin is very active. It is constantly being renewed. How does this happen? 1. The cells at the bottom of the epidermis are always dividing by mitosis to form new cells. 2. The new cells gradually move up through the epidermis toward the surface of the body. As they move, they produce the tough, fibrous protein called keratin. 3. By the time the cells reach the surface, they have filled with keratin and died. On the surface, the dead cells form a protective, waterproof layer. 4. Dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the epidermis. As they are shed, they are replaced by other dead cells that move up from below. The epidermis also contains cells called melanocytes. You can see a melanocyte in Figure 16.7. Melanocytes produce melanin. Melanin is a brown pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyones skin has about the same number of melanocytes per square inch. However, the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin that is produced depends partly on your genes and partly on how much ultraviolet light strikes your skin. The more light you get, the more melanin your melanocytes produce. This explains why skin tans when its exposed to sunlight. ",
      "topic_T_2129": "The dermis is the inner layer of skin. It is made of tough connective tissue. The dermis is attached to the epidermis by fibers made of the protein collagen. The dermis is where most skin structures are located. Look again at Figure pain, pressure, and temperature. If you cut your skin and it bleeds, the cut has penetrated the dermis and damaged a blood vessel. The cut probably hurts as well because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. You can see some of these structures in Figure 16.8. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface. Sebaceous glands are commonly called oil glands. They produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles. Then it makes its way along the hair shaft to the surface of the skin. Sebum waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out. Sweat glands produce the salty fluid known as sweat. Sweat contains excess water, salts, and other waste products. Each sweat gland has a duct that passes through the epidermis. Sweat travels from the gland through the duct and out through a pore on the surface of the skin. ",
      "topic_T_2130": "You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. In several ways, it helps maintain homeostasis. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. Melanin in the epidermis absorbs ultraviolet light. This prevents the light from reaching and damaging the dermis. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, increasing blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface and radiate into the environment. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, decreasing blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface so less heat is lost to the environment. ",
      "topic_T_2131": "What can you do to keep your skin healthy? The most important step you can take is to protect your skin from sun exposure. On sunny days, wear long sleeves and pants and a hat with a brim. Also apply sunscreen to exposed areas of skin. Protecting your skin in these ways will reduce damage to your skin by ultraviolet light. This is important because skin that has been damaged by ultraviolet light is at greater risk of developing skin cancer. This is true whether the damage is due to sunlight or the light in tanning beds. About 85 percent of teens develop acne, like the boy in Figure 16.9. Acne is a condition in which pimples form on the skin. It is caused by a bacterial infection. It happens when the sebaceous glands secrete too much sebum. The excess oil provides a good place for bacteria to grow. Keeping the skin clean helps prevent acne. Over-the-counter products or prescription drugs may be needed if the problem is serious or doesnt clear up on its own. ",
      "topic_T_2132": "You may spend a lot of time and money on your hair and nails. You may think of them as accessories, like clothes or jewelry. However, like the skin, the hair and nails also play important roles in helping the body maintain homeostasis. ",
      "topic_T_2133": "Only mammals have hair. Hair is a fiber made mainly of the tough protein keratin. The cells of each hair are filled with keratin and no longer alive. The dead cells overlap each other, almost like shingles on a roof. They work like shingles as well, by helping shed water from hair. Head hair helps protect the scalp from sun exposure. It also helps insulate the body. It traps air so heat cant escape from the head. Hair in eyelashes and eyebrows helps keep water and dust out of the eyes. Hairs inside the nostrils of the nose trap dust and germs in the air so they cant reach the lungs. ",
      "topic_T_2134": "Fingernails and toenails are made of specialized cells that grow out of the epidermis. They too are filled with keratin. The keratin makes them tough and hard. Their job is to protect the ends of the fingers and toes. They also make it easier to feel things with the sensitive fingertips by acting as a counterforce when things are handled. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "5. Why does it usually hurt to cut the skin but not the hair or nails? ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "The skin is the major organ of the integumentary system. Hair and nails are also part of this organ system. All three organs provide a protective covering for the body. They also help the body maintain homeostasis. For a good video overview of the integumentary system, watch this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: ",

The skin consists of two distinct layers, an outer layer called the epidermis and an inner layer called the dermis. The epidermis is constantly being renewed as dead cells on the surface are shed. This layer contains melanin- producing melanocytes. The dermis contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands. The skin prevents loss of water from the body and keeps out microorganisms. Melanin in the epidermis protects the dermis from damaging ultraviolet light.

      "topic_T_0170": "Most ocean waves are caused by winds. A wave is the transfer of energy through matter. A wave that travels across miles of ocean is traveling energy, not water. Ocean waves transfer energy from wind through water. The energy of a wave may travel for thousands of miles. The water itself moves very little. Figure 14.9 shows how water molecules move when a wave goes by. ",
      "topic_T_0171": "Figure 14.9 also shows how the size of waves is measured. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days. ",
      "topic_T_0172": "Figure 14.10 shows what happens to waves near shore. As waves move into shallow water, they start to touch the bottom. The base of the waves drag and slow.

Tsunami waves can flood entire regions. They destroy property and cause many deaths. Figure 14.11 shows the damage caused by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004. ",

Low tides occur when the water reaches its lowest level in a day. Tides keep cycling from high to low and back again. In most places the water level rises and falls twice a day. So there are two high tides and two low tides approximately every 24 hours. In Figure 14.12, you can see the difference between high and low tides. This is called the tidal range. ",
      "topic_T_0175": "Figure 14.13 shows why tides occur. The main cause of tides is the pull of the Moons gravity on Earth. The pull is greatest on whatever is closest to the Moon. Although the gravity pulls the land, only the water can move. As a result: Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon is pulled hardest by the Moons gravity. This causes a bulge of water on that side of Earth. That bulge is a high tide. Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moons gravity than is the ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon. As a result, there is bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth. This creates another high tide. With water bulging on two sides of Earth, theres less water left in between. This creates low tides on the other two sides of the planet. ",
      "topic_T_0176": "The Suns gravity also pulls on Earth and its oceans. Even though the Sun is much larger than the Moon, the pull of the Suns gravity is much less because the Sun is much farther away. The Suns gravity strengthens or weakens the Moons influence on tides. Figure 14.14 shows the position of the Moon relative to the Sun at different times during the month. The positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other determines how the Sun affects tides. This creates spring tides or neap tides. Spring tides occur during the new moon and full moon. The Sun and Moon are in a straight line either on the same side of Earth or on opposite sides. Their gravitational pull combines to cause very high and very low tides. Spring tides have the greatest tidal range. Neap tides occur during the first and third quarters of the Moon. The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other. Their gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and lows are not as great. Neap tides have the smallest tidal range. This animation shows the effect of the Moon and Sun on the tides: ",
      "topic_T_0177": "Another way ocean water moves is in currents. A current is a stream of moving water that flows through the ocean. Surface currents are caused mainly by winds, but not the winds that blow and change each day. Surface currents are caused by the major wind belts that blow in the same direction all the time. The major surface currents are shown in Figure 14.15. They flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemi- sphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, they flow in the opposite direction. ",
      "topic_T_0178": "Winds and surface currents tend to move from the hot equator north or south toward the much cooler poles. Thats because of differences in the temperature of air masses over Earths surface. But Earth is spinning on its axis underneath the wind and water as they move. The Earth rotates from west to east. As a result, winds and currents actually end up moving toward the northeast or southeast. This effect of Earths rotation on the direction of winds and currents is called the Coriolis effect. ",
      "topic_T_0179": "Large ocean currents can have a big impact on the climate of nearby coasts. The Gulf Stream, for example, carries warm water from near the equator up the eastern coast of North America. Look at the map in Figure 14.16. It shows how the Gulf Stream warms both the water and land along the coast. ",
      "topic_T_0180": "Currents also flow deep below the surface of the ocean. Deep currents are caused by differences in density at the top and bottom. Density is defined as the amount of mass per unit of volume. More dense water takes up less space than less dense water. It has the same mass but less volume. Water that is more dense sinks. Less dense water rises. What can make water more dense? Water becomes more dense when it is colder and when it has more salt. In the North Atlantic Ocean, cold winds chill the water at the surface. Sea ice grows in this cold water, but ice is created from fresh water. The salt is left behind in the seawater. This cold, salty water is very dense, so it sinks to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Downwelling can take place in other places where surface water becomes very dense (see Figure 14.17). When water sinks it pushes deep water along at the bottom of the ocean. This water circulates through all of the ocean basins in deep currents. ",
      "topic_T_0181": "Sometimes deep ocean water rises to the surface. This is called upwelling. Figure 14.18 shows why it happens. Strong winds blow surface water away from shore. This allows deeper water to flow to the surface and take its place. When water comes up from the deep, it brings a lot of nutrients with it. Why is deep water so full of nutrients? Over time, dead organisms and other organic matter settle to the bottom water and collect. The nutrient-rich water that comes to the surface by upwelling supports many living things. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "6. The crest of an ocean wave is 3 meters above the still water level. The trough is 3 meters below the still water level. The horizontal distance between the crest and trough is 8 meters. Draw a diagram of this wave. Label the crest, trough, and distances. Then calculate the waves amplitude and wavelength. 7. Assume that a spring tide occurs on September 1. Predict when the next neap tide will occur. When will the next spring tide occur? Explain your answers. ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "If youve ever visited an ocean shore, then you know that ocean water is always moving. Waves ripple through the water, as shown in Figure 14.8. The water slowly rises and falls because of tides. You may see signs warning of currents that flow close to shore. What causes all these ocean motions? Different types of motions have different causes. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "Describe how waves move through water.\nExplain what causes tides.\nGive an overview of surface currents.\nIdentify the cause of deep currents.\nDescribe upwelling.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Most ocean waves are caused by winds. The size of a wave depends on how fast, how far, and how long the wind blows. Tsunamis are waves caused by earthquakes. Tides are daily changes in the level of ocean water. They are caused mainly by the pull of the Moons gravity on Earth and its oceans. The Suns gravity also influences tides. Surface currents are like streams flowing through the surface of the ocean. They are caused mainly by winds. Earths rotation influences their direction. This is called the Coriolis effect. Surface currents may affect the climate of nearby coasts. Deep currents are convection currents that occur far below the surface. They are caused by differences in the density of ocean water. Upwelling occurs when deep ocean water rises to the surface. The water brings nutrients with it. These nutrients support many organisms. ",
      "adjunct_Points to Consider": "Upwelling brings nutrients to the surface from the ocean floor. Nutrients are important resources for ocean life. However, they arent the only resources on the ocean floor. What other resources do you think might be found on the ocean floor? Its hard to get resources from the ocean floor. Can you explain why? ",

In reality, high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes. Can you think of why this would be the case? 10. Are deep currents the same as surface currents except that they are near the ocean bottom? "

      "topic_T_1641": "A rocket is propelled into space by particles flying out of one end at high speed (see Figure 1.1). A rocket in space moves like a skater holding the fire extinguisher. Fuel is ignited in a chamber, which causes an explosion of gases. The explosion creates pressure that forces the gases out of the rocket. As these gases rush out the end, the rocket moves in the opposite direction, as predicted by Newtons Third Law of Motion. The reaction force of the gases on the rocket pushes the rocket forward. The force pushing the rocket is called thrust. Nothing would get into space without being thrust upward by a rocket. ",
      "topic_T_1642": "One of the first uses of rockets in space was to launch satellites. A satellite is an object that orbits a larger object. An orbit is a circular or elliptical path around an object. The Moon was Earths first satellite, but now many human- made \"artificial satellites\" orbit the planet. Thousands of artificial satellites have been put into orbit around Earth (Figure 1.2). We have even put satellites into orbit around the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. There are four main types of satellites. Imaging satellites take pictures of Earths surface for military or scientific purposes. Imaging satellites study the Moon and other planets. Communications satellites receive and send signals for telephone, television, or other types of communica- tions. Navigational satellites are used for navigation systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). The International Space Station, the largest artificial satellite, is designed for humans to live in space while conducting scientific research. ",

Modern space stations are constructed piece by piece to create a modular system. The primary purpose of the ISS is scientific research, especially in medicine, biology, and physics. ",
      "topic_T_1644": "Craft designed for human spaceflight, like the Apollo missions, were very successful, but were also very expensive, could not carry much cargo, and could be used only once. To outfit the ISS, NASA needed a space vehicle that was reusable and able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The resulting spacecraft was a space shuttle, shown in (Figure 1.4). Satellites operate with solar panels for energy. A photograph of the International Space Station was taken from the space shuttle Atlantis in June 2007. Construction of the station was completed in 2011, but new pieces and experiments continue to be added. A space shuttle has three main parts. The part you are probably most familiar with is the orbiter, with wings like an airplane. When a space shuttle launches, the orbiter is attached to a huge fuel tank that contains liquid fuel. On the sides of the fuel tank are two large \"booster rockets.\" All of this is needed to get the orbiter out of Earths atmosphere. Once in space, the orbiter can be used to release equipment (such as a satellite or supplies for the International Space Station), to repair existing equipment such as the Hubble Space Telescope, or to do experiments directly on board the orbiter. When the mission is complete, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere and flies back to Earth more like a glider than an airplane. The Space Shuttle program did 135 missions between 1981 and 2011, when the remaining shuttles were retired. The ISS is now serviced by Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Atlantis on the launch pad in 2006. Since 1981, the space shuttle has been the United States primary vehicle for carrying people and large equipment into space. ",

      "topic_T_3817": "Look at the classroom in Figure 22.1. It has several sources of visible light. One source of visible light is the sun. Sunlight enters the classroom through the windows. The sun provides virtually all of the visible light that living things need. Visible light travels across space from the sun to Earth in electromagnetic waves. But how does the sun produce light? Read on to find out. ",
      "topic_T_3818": "The sun and other stars produce light because they are so hot. They glow with light due to their extremely high temperatures. This way of producing light is called incandescence. Some objects produce light without becoming very hot. They generate light through chemical reactions or other processes. Producing light without heat is called luminescence. Objects that produce light by luminescence are said to be luminous. Luminescence, in turn, can occur in different ways: One type of luminescence is called fluorescence. In this process, a substance absorbs shorter-wavelength light, such as ultraviolet light, and then gives off light in the visible range of wavelengths. Certain minerals produce light in this way. Another type of luminescence is called electroluminescence. In this process, a substance gives off light when an electric current runs through it. Some gases produce light in this way. A third type of luminescence is called bioluminescence. This is the production of light by living things as a result of chemical reactions. Examples of bioluminescent organisms are pictured in Figure 22.2. You can learn more about bioluminescence in the video at this URL:  Many other objects appear to produce their own light, but they actually just reflect light from another source. The moon is a good example. It appears to glow in the sky from its own light, but in reality it is just reflecting light from the sun. Objects like the moon that are lit up by another source of light are said to be illuminated. Everything you can see that doesnt produce its own light is illuminated. ",
      "topic_T_3819": "The classroom in Figure 22.1 has artificial light sources in addition to natural sunlight. There are fluorescent lights on the ceiling of the room. There are also projectors on the ceiling that are shining light on screens. In these and most other artificial light sources, electricity provides the energy and some type of light bulb converts the electrical energy to visible light. How a light bulb produces visible light varies by type of bulb, as you can see in Table 22.1. Incandescent light bulbs, which produce light by incandescence, give off a lot of heat as well as light, so they waste energy. Other light bulbs produce light by luminescence, so they produce little if any heat. These light bulbs use energy more efficiently. Which types of light bulbs do you use? Type of Light Bulb Incandescent Light Description An incandescent light bulb produces visible light by incandescence. The bulb contains a thin wire filament made of tungsten. When electric current passes through the filament, it gets extremely hot and glows. You can learn more about incandescent light bulbs at the URL below. Fluorescent Light A fluorescent light bulb produces visible light by flu- orescence. The bulb contains mercury gas that gives off ultraviolet light when electricity passes through it. The inside of the bulb is coated with a substance called phosphor. The phosphor absorbs the ultraviolet light and then gives off most of the energy as visible light. You can learn more about fluorescent light bulbs at this URL: http://science.discovery.com/videos/deco Type of Light Bulb Neon Light Vapor Light LED Light Description A neon light produces visible light by electrolumines- cence. The bulb is a glass tube that contains the noble gas neon. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, causing them to give off visible light. Neon produces red light. Other noble gases are also used in lights, and they produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light. A vapor light produces visible light by electrolumi- nescence. The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting. LED stands for light-emitting diode. This type of light contains a material, called a semi-conductor, which gives off visible light when a current runs through it. LED lights are used for traffic lights and indicator lights on computers, cars, and many other devices. This type of light is very reliable and durable. ",
      "topic_T_3820": "When visible light strikes matter, it interacts with it. How light interacts with matter depends on the type of matter. ",
      "topic_T_3821": "Light may interact with matter in several ways. Light may be reflected by matter. Reflected light bounces back when it strikes matter. Reflection of light is similar to reflection of sound waves. You can read more about reflection of light later on in this chapter in the lesson Optics. Light may be refracted by matter. The light is bent when it passes from one type of matter to another. Refraction of light is similar to refraction of sound waves. You can also read more about refraction of light in the lesson Optics. Light may pass through matter. This is called transmission of light. As light is transmitted, it may be scattered by particles of matter and spread out in all directions. This is called scattering of light. Light may be absorbed by matter. This is called absorption of light. When light is absorbed, it doesnt reflect from or pass through matter. Instead, its energy is transferred to particles of matter, which may increase the temperature of matter. ",
      "topic_T_3822": "Matter can be classified on the basis of how light interacts with it. Matter may be transparent, translucent, or opaque. Each type of matter is illustrated in Figure 22.3. Transparent matter is matter that transmits light without scattering it. Examples of transparent matter include air, pure water, and clear glass. You can see clearly through a transparent object, such as the revolving glass doors in the figure, because all the light passes straight through it. Translucent matter is matter that transmits but scatters light. Light passes through a translucent object but you cannot see clearly through the object because the light is scattered in all directions. The frosted glass doors in the figure are translucent. Opaque matter is matter that does not let any light pass through it. Matter may be opaque because it absorbs light, reflects light, or does both. Examples of opaque objects are solid wooden doors and glass mirrors. A wooden door absorbs most of the light that strikes it and reflects just a few wavelengths of visible light. A mirror, which is a sheet of glass with a shiny metal coating on the back, reflects all the light that strikes it. ",
      "topic_T_3823": "Visible light consists of a range of wavelengths. The wavelength of visible light determines the color that the light appears. As you can see in Figure 22.4, light with the longest wavelength appears red, and light with the shortest wavelength appears violet. In between is a continuum of all the other colors of light. Only a few colors of light are represented in the figure. ",
      "topic_T_3824": "A prism, like the one in Figure 22.5, can be used to separate visible light into its different colors. A prism is a pyramid-shaped object made of transparent matter, usually clear glass. It transmits light but slows it down. When light passes from the air to the glass of the prism, the change in speed causes the light to bend. Different wavelengths of light bend at different angles. This causes the beam of light to separate into light of different wavelengths. What we see is a rainbow of colors. Look back at the rainbow that opened this chapter. Do you see all the different colors of light, from red at the top to violet at the bottom? Individual raindrops act as tiny prisms. They separate sunlight into its different wavelengths and create a rainbow. For an animated version of Figure 22.5, go to the URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Light_dispersion_conce ",
      "topic_T_3825": "We see an opaque object, such as the apple in Figure 22.6, because it reflects some wavelengths of visible light. The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that the object appears. For example, the apple in the figure appears red because it reflects red light and absorbs light of other wavelengths. We see a transparent or translucent object, such as the bottle in Figure 22.6, because it transmits light. The wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears. For example, the bottle in the figure appears blue because it transmits blue light. The color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears. For example, if only blue light strikes a red apple, the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected. When no light reflects from an object, it looks black. Black isnt a color. It is the absence of light. ",
      "topic_T_3826": "The human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These three colors of light are called primary colors. All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors. As you can see in Figure 22.7, when red and green light combine, they form yellow. When red and blue light combine, they form magenta, a dark pinkish color, and when blue and green light combine, they form cyan, a bluish green color. Yellow, magenta, and cyan are called the secondary colors of light. Look at the center of the diagram in Figure 22.7. When all three primary colors combine, they form white light. White is the color of the full spectrum of visible light when all of its wavelengths are combined. You can explore the colors of visible light and how they combine with the interactive animations at this URL:  . ",
      "topic_T_3827": "Many objects have color because they contain pigments. A pigment is a substance that colors materials by reflecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. A very common pigment is chlorophyll, which is found in plants. This dark green pigment absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light. It is responsible for capturing the light energy needed for photosynthesis. Pigments are also found in paints, inks, and dyes. Just three pigments, called primary pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors. The primary pigment colors are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan, magenta, and yellow. The printer ink cartridges in Figure 22.8 come in just these three colors. They are the only colors needed for full-color printing. ",

Wind blowing across the water transfers energy to that water. The energy first creates tiny ripples, which make an uneven surface for the wind to catch so that it may create larger waves. These waves travel across the ocean out of the area where the wind is blowing. Remember that a wave is a transfer of energy. Do you think the same molecules of water that start out in a wave in the middle of the ocean later arrive at the shore? The molecules are not the same, but the energy is transferred across the ocean.

The positive ions form a lattice-like structure. You can see an example in Figure 7.13. (For an animated version, go to the URL below.) The ions are held together in the lattice by bonds with the valence electrons around them. These valence electrons include their own and those of other ions. Why do metallic bonds form? Recall that metals \"want\" to give up their valence electrons. This means that their valence electrons move freely. The electrons form a \"sea\" of negative charge surrounding the positive ions.

They are ductile (can be shaped into wires) and malleable (can be shaped into thin sheets). Metals have these properties because of the nature of their metallic bonds. A metallic lattice, like the one in Figure 7.13, may resemble a rigid ionic crystal. However, it is much more flexible. Look at Figure 7.14. It shows a blacksmith hammering a piece of red-hot iron in order to shape it. Why doesnt the iron shatter, as an ionic crystal would? The ions of the metal can move within the \"sea\" of electrons without breaking the metallic bonds that hold them together. The ions can shift closer together or farther apart.

Steel is also used to make skyscrapers, cargo ships, cars, and trains. Steel is an example of an alloy. An alloy is a mixture of a metal with one or more other elements. The other elements may be metals, nonmetals, or both. An alloy is a solid solution. It is formed by melting a metal and dissolving the other elements in it.

      "topic_T_2428": "Water pollution has many causes. One of the biggest causes is fertilizer in runoff. Runoff dissolves fertilizer as it flows over farm fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the dissolved fertilizer into bodies of water. More dissolved fertilizer may enter a body of water at the mouth of a river, but there is generally no single point where this type of pollution enters the water. Thats why this type of water pollution is called nonpoint-source pollution. ",
      "topic_T_2429": "When fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients cause excessive growth of algae. This is called an algal bloom. You can see one in Figure 25.5. The algae out-compete other water organisms. They may make the water unfit for human consumption or recreation. ",
      "topic_T_2430": "Eventually, the algae in an algal bloom die and decompose. Their decomposition uses up oxygen in the water so that the water becomes hypoxic (without oxygen). This has occurred in many bodies of fresh water and large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones. Dead zones are areas where the hypoxic water cant support life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico (see Figure 25.6). Nutrients carried into the Gulf by the Mississippi River caused this dead zone. Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers is one way to prevent dead zones in bodies of water. Preserving wetlands is also important. Wetlands are habitats such as swamps, marshes, and bogs where the ground is soggy or covered with water much of the year. Wetlands slow down and filter runoff before it reaches bodies of water. Wetlands also provide breeding grounds for many different species of organisms. ",
      "topic_T_2431": "Unlike runoff, which enters bodies of water everywhere, some sources of pollution enter the water at a single point. This type of water pollution is called point-source pollution. ",
      "topic_T_2432": "An example of point-source pollution is the release of pollution into a body of water through a pipe from a factory or sewage treatment plant. Waste water from a factory might contain dangerous chemicals such as strong acids, mercury, or lead. Water from a sewage treatment plant might contain untreated or partially treated sewage. Such pollution can make water dangerous for drinking or other uses. You can learn more about the problem of sewage contaminating the water in U.S. coastal communities by watching this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  In poor nations, many people have no choice but to drink water from polluted sources. Drinking sewage-contaminated water causes waterborne diseases, due to pathogens such as protozoa, viruses, or bacteria. Most waterborne diseases cause diarrhea. ",
      "topic_T_2433": "If heated water is released into a body of water, it may cause thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water because of an increase in water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and factories. This water is heated and then returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature. Warm water cant hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water, so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains. Fish and other organisms adapted to a particular temperature range and oxygen concentration may be killed by the change in water temperature. ",

Plastics may take hundreds or even thousands of years to break down. In the meantime, the waste can be very dangerous to aquatic organisms. Some organisms may swallow plastic bags, for example, and others may be strangled by plastic six-pack rings. You can see some of the trash that routinely washes up on coastlines in Figure 25.7.

As a result, ocean water is also dissolving more carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms a weak acid. With higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water, the water becomes more acidic. This process is called ocean acidification. Ocean acidification can kill some aquatic organisms, including corals and shellfish. It may make it more difficult for other aquatic organisms to reproduce. Both effects of acidification interfere with marine food webs, threatening the survival of many aquatic organisms. ",

Water pollution is an increasing problem. It occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter water resources. Water pollution is threatening the limited supply of water that human beings and other living things depend on. Already, more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have enough clean, fresh water.

The remains inside the rock also turn to rock. The remains are replaced by minerals. The remains literally turn to stone. Fossilization is illustrated in Figure 11.2. ",
      "topic_T_0067": "Fossils may form in other ways. With complete preservation, the organism doesnt change much. As seen below, tree sap may cover an organism and then turn into amber. The original organism is preserved so that scientists might be able to study its DNA. Organisms can also be completely preserved in tar or ice. Molds and casts are another way organisms can be fossilized. A mold is an imprint of an organism left in rock. The organisms remains break down completely. Rock that fills in the mold resembles the original remains. The fossil that forms in the mold is called a cast. Molds and casts usually form in sedimentary rock. With compression, an organisms remains are put under great pressure inside rock layers. This leaves behind a dark stain in the rock. You can read about them in Figure 11.3. ",

Remains also may be broken down by other living things or by the elements. Hard parts, such as bones, are much more likely to become fossils. But even they rarely last long enough to become fossils. Organisms without hard parts are the least likely to be fossilized. Fossils of soft organisms, from bacteria to jellyfish, are very rare. ",

An example is shown in the Figure 11.4. Fossils of plants are found in Antarctica. Currently, Antarctica is almost completely covered with ice. The fossil plants show that Antarctica once had a much warmer climate. ",

If nothing is done to decrease the rate of CO2 emissions, by 2030, CO2 emissions are projected to be 63% greater than they were in 2002. ",
      "topic_T_1303": "Computer models are used to predict the effects of greenhouse gas increases on climate for the planet as a whole and also for specific regions. If nothing is done to control greenhouse gas emissions and they continue to increase at current rates, the surface temperature of the Earth can be expected to increase between 0.5o C and 2.0o C (0.9o F and 3.6o F) by 2050 and between 2o and 4.5o C (3.5o and 8o F) by 2100, with CO2 levels over 800 parts per million (ppm). Global CO2 emissions are rising rapidly. The industrial revolution began about 1850 and industrialization has been ac- celerating.

So far, global warming has affected the North Pole more than the South Pole, but temperatures are still increasing at Antarctica (Figure 1.2). ",
      "topic_T_1304": "As greenhouse gases increase, changes will be more extreme. Oceans will become more acidic, making it more difficult for creatures with carbonate shells to grow, and that includes coral reefs. A study monitoring ocean acidity in the Pacific Northwest found ocean acidity increasing ten times faster than expected and 10% to 20% of shellfish (mussels) being replaced by acid-tolerant algae. Plant and animal species seeking cooler temperatures will need to move poleward 100 to 150 km (60 to 90 miles) or upward 150 m (500 feet) for each 1.0o C (8o F) rise in global temperature. There will be a tremendous loss of biodiversity because forest species cant migrate that rapidly. Biologists have already documented the extinction of high-altitude species that have nowhere higher to go. Decreased snow packs, shrinking glaciers, and the earlier arrival of spring will all lessen the amount of water available in some regions of the world, including the western United States and much of Asia. Ice will continue to melt and sea level is predicted to rise 18 to 97 cm (7 to 38 inches) by 2100 (Figure 1.3). An increase this large will gradually flood coastal regions, where about one-third of the worlds population lives, forcing billions of people to move inland. Sea ice thickness around the North Pole has been decreasing in recent decades and will continue to decrease in the com- ing decades. Weather will become more extreme, with more frequent and more intense heat waves and droughts. Some modelers predict that the midwestern United States will become too dry to support agriculture and that Canada will become the new breadbasket. In all, about 10% to 50% of current cropland worldwide may become unusable if CO2 doubles. You may notice that the numerical predictions above contain wide ranges. Sea level, for example, is expected to rise somewhere between 18 and 97 cm  quite a wide range. What is the reason for this uncertainty? It is partly because scientists cannot predict exactly how the Earth will respond to increased levels of greenhouses gases. How quickly greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere depends in part on the choices we make. An important question people ask is this: Are the increases in global temperature natural? In other words, can natural variations in temperature account for the increase in temperature that we see? The answer is no. Changes in the Suns irradiance, El Nio and La Nia cycles, natural changes in greenhouse gas, and other atmospheric gases cannot account for the increase in temperature that has already happened in the past decades. Along with the rest of the worlds oceans, San Francisco Bay is rising. Changes are happening slowly in the coastal arena of the San Francisco Bay Area and even the most optimistic estimates about how high and how quickly this rise will occur indicate potentially huge problems for the region.

It allows light to enter the eye. The pupil automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed. The iris is the colored part of the eye. It controls the size of the pupil. The lens is a convex lens that fine-tunes the focus so an image forms on the back of the eye. Tiny muscles control the shape of the lens to focus images of close or distant objects. The retina is a membrane lining the back of the eye. The retina has nerve cells called rods and cones that change images to electrical signals. Rods are good at sensing dim light but cant distinguish different colors of light. Cones can sense colors but not in dim light. There are three different types of cones. Each type senses one of the three primary colors of light. The optic nerve carries electrical signals from the rods and cones to the brain. ",
      "topic_T_3846": "As just described, the eyes collect and focus visible light. The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus a real image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in Figure 22.25. The image reaches the brain as electrical signals that travel through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the signals as shape, color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see is always right-side up. The brain also tells us what we are seeing. ",
      "topic_T_3847": "Many people have vision problems. The problems often can be corrected with contact lenses or lenses in eyeglasses. Some vision problems can also be corrected with laser surgery, which reshapes the cornea. Two of the most common vision problems are nearsightedness and farsightedness. You may even have one of these conditions yourself. Both are illustrated in Figure 22.26 and in the video at this URL:  (1:08). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the condition in which nearby objects are seen clearly, but distant objects are blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is longer than normal. This causes images to be focused in front of the retina. Myopia can be corrected with concave lenses. The lenses focus images farther back in the eye, so they are on the retina instead of in front of it. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects are blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal. This causes images to be focused in back of the retina. Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they are on the retina instead of behind it. ",

      "topic_T_2428": "Water pollution has many causes. One of the biggest causes is fertilizer in runoff. Runoff dissolves fertilizer as it flows over farm fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the dissolved fertilizer into bodies of water. More dissolved fertilizer may enter a body of water at the mouth of a river, but there is generally no single point where this type of pollution enters the water. Thats why this type of water pollution is called nonpoint-source pollution. ",
      "topic_T_2429": "When fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients cause excessive growth of algae. This is called an algal bloom. You can see one in Figure 25.5. The algae out-compete other water organisms. They may make the water unfit for human consumption or recreation. ",
      "topic_T_2430": "Eventually, the algae in an algal bloom die and decompose. Their decomposition uses up oxygen in the water so that the water becomes hypoxic (without oxygen). This has occurred in many bodies of fresh water and large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones. Dead zones are areas where the hypoxic water cant support life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico (see Figure 25.6). Nutrients carried into the Gulf by the Mississippi River caused this dead zone. Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers is one way to prevent dead zones in bodies of water. Preserving wetlands is also important. Wetlands are habitats such as swamps, marshes, and bogs where the ground is soggy or covered with water much of the year. Wetlands slow down and filter runoff before it reaches bodies of water. Wetlands also provide breeding grounds for many different species of organisms. ",
      "topic_T_2431": "Unlike runoff, which enters bodies of water everywhere, some sources of pollution enter the water at a single point. This type of water pollution is called point-source pollution. ",
      "topic_T_2432": "An example of point-source pollution is the release of pollution into a body of water through a pipe from a factory or sewage treatment plant. Waste water from a factory might contain dangerous chemicals such as strong acids, mercury, or lead. Water from a sewage treatment plant might contain untreated or partially treated sewage. Such pollution can make water dangerous for drinking or other uses. You can learn more about the problem of sewage contaminating the water in U.S. coastal communities by watching this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  In poor nations, many people have no choice but to drink water from polluted sources. Drinking sewage-contaminated water causes waterborne diseases, due to pathogens such as protozoa, viruses, or bacteria. Most waterborne diseases cause diarrhea. ",
      "topic_T_2433": "If heated water is released into a body of water, it may cause thermal pollution. Thermal pollution is a reduction in the quality of water because of an increase in water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and factories. This water is heated and then returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature. Warm water cant hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water, so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains. Fish and other organisms adapted to a particular temperature range and oxygen concentration may be killed by the change in water temperature. ",
      "topic_T_2434": "The ocean is huge but even this body of water is becoming seriously polluted. Climate change also affects the quality of ocean water for living things. ",
      "topic_T_2435": "One way that the ocean is becoming polluted is with trash, mainly plastics. The waste comes from shipping accidents, landfill erosion, and the dumping of trash. Plastics may take hundreds or even thousands of years to break down. In the meantime, the waste can be very dangerous to aquatic organisms. Some organisms may swallow plastic bags, for example, and others may be strangled by plastic six-pack rings. You can see some of the trash that routinely washes up on coastlines in Figure 25.7. There are five massive garbage patches floating on the Pacific Ocean. Watch this video to learn more about them:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: ",
      "topic_T_2436": "Ocean water normally dissolves some of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, ocean water is also dissolving more carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms a weak acid. With higher levels of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean water, the water becomes more acidic. This process is called ocean acidification. Ocean acidification can kill some aquatic organisms, including corals and shellfish. It may make it more difficult for other aquatic organisms to reproduce. Both effects of acidification interfere with marine food webs, threatening the survival of many aquatic organisms. ",

Most of the rest of Earths water is either salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps. Although water is constantly recycled through the water cycle, Earths water is in danger. Water pollution is an increasing problem. It occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter water resources. Water pollution is threatening the limited supply of water that human beings and other living things depend on. Already, more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have enough clean, fresh water. With the rapidly growing human population and global climate change, the water shortage is likely to get worse. ",

Radiation is the transfer of energy between two objects by electromagnetic waves. Heat radiates from the ground into the lower atmosphere. In conduction, heat moves from areas of more heat to areas of less heat by direct contact. Warmer molecules vibrate rapidly and collide with other nearby molecules, transferring their energy. In the atmosphere, conduction is more effective at lower altitudes, where air density is higher. This transfers heat upward to where the molecules are spread further apart or transfers heat laterally from a warmer to a cooler spot, where the molecules are moving less vigorously.

Heat and/or pressure then change the rocks physical or chemical makeup. During metamorphism a rock may change chemically. Ions move and new minerals form. The new minerals are more stable in the new environment. Extreme pressure may lead to physical changes like foliation. Foliation forms as the rocks are squeezed. If pressure is exerted from one direction, the rock forms layers. This is foliation. If pressure is exerted from all directions, the rock usually does not show foliation. There are two main types of metamorphism: 1. Contact metamorphism results when magma contacts a rock, changing it by extreme heat (Figure 4.14). 2. Regional metamorphism occurs over a wide area. Great masses of rock are exposed to pressure from rock and sediment layers on top of it. The rock may also be compressed by other geological processes. Metamorphism does not cause a rock to melt completely. It only causes the minerals to change by heat or pressure. Hornfels is a rock with alternating bands of dark and light crystals. Hornfels is a good example of how minerals rearrange themselves during metamorphism (Figure 4.14). The minerals in hornfels separate by density. The result is that the rock becomes banded.

      "topic_T_3628": "Work is defined differently in physics than in everyday language. In physics, work means the use of force to move an object. The teen who is playing tennis in Figure 16.1 is using force to move her tennis racket, so she is doing work. The teen who is studying isnt moving anything, so she is not doing work. Not all force that is used to move an object does work. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. If a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is done. Figure 16.2 illustrates this point. The stick person applies an upward force on the box when raising it from the ground to chest height. Work is done because the force is applied in the same direction as the box is moving. However, as the stick person walks from left to right while holding the box at chest height, no more work is done by the persons arms holding the box up. Thats because the force supporting the box acts in a different direction than the box is moving. A small amount of work in the horizontal direction is performed when the person is accelerating during the first step of the walk across the room. But other than that, there is no work, because there is no net force acting on the box horizontally. ",
      "topic_T_3629": "Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves. It can be represented by the equation: Work = Force  Distance This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an object or the farther the object is moved, the more work that is done. You can see a short video introduction to work as the product of force and distance at this link:  . To see the effects of force and distance on work, compare the weight lifters in Figure 16.3. The two weight lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight, but the bottom weight lifter is lifting the weight a longer distance. Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work. The two weight lifters on the bottom right are both lifting the weight the same distance, but the weight lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight. Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work. ",
      "topic_T_3630": "The equation for work given above can be used to calculate the amount of work that is done if force and distance are known. For example, assume that one of the weight lifters in Figure 16.2 lifts a weight of 400 newtons over his head to a height of 2.2 meters off the ground. The amount of work he does is: Work = 400 N  2.2 m = 880 N  m Notice that the unit for work is the newton  meter. This is the SI unit for work, also called the joule (J). One joule equals the amount of work that is done when 1 newton of force moves an object over a distance of 1 meter. Problem Solving Problem: Todd pushed a 500 N box 4 meters across the floor. How much work did he do? Solution: Use the equation Work = Force  Distance. Work = 500 N  4 m = 2000 N  m, or 2000 J You Try It! Problem: Lara lifted a 100 N box 1.5 meters above the floor. How much work did she do? ",

But if you use an electric leaf blower, like the man in the figure, the job gets done much sooner. Both the leaf blower and the rake do the work of removing leaves from the yard, but the leaf blower has more power. Thats why it can do the same amount of work in less time. ",
      "topic_T_3632": "Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time. Power can be represented by the equation: Power = Work Time In this equation, work is measured in joules and time is measured in seconds, so power is expressed in joules per second (J/s). This is the SI unit for work, also known as the watt (W). A watt equals 1 joule of work per second. The watt is named for James Watt, a Scottish inventor you will read about below. You may already be familiar with watts. Thats because light bulbs and small appliances such as hair dryers are labeled with the watts of power they provide. For example, the hair dryer in Figure 16.5 is labeled \"2000 watts.\" This amount of power could also be expressed kilowatts. A kilowatt equals 1000 watts, so the 2000-watt hair dryer produces 2 kilowatts of power. Compared with a less powerful device, a more powerful device can either do more work in the same time or do the same work in less time. For example, compared with a low-power microwave, a high-power microwave can cook more food in the same time or the same amount of food in less time. ",
      "topic_T_3633": "Power can be calculated using the formula above, if the amount of work and time are known. For example, assume that a small engine does 3000 joules of work in 2 seconds. Then the power of the motor is: Power = 3000 J = 1500 J/s, or 1500 W 2s You can also calculate work if you know power and time by rewriting the power equation above as: Work = Power  Time For example, if you use a 2000-watt hair dryer for 30 seconds, how much work is done? First express 2000 watts in J/s and then substitute this value for power in the work equation: Work = 2000 J/s  30 s = 60, 000 J For a video presentation on calculating power and work, go to this link:  Problem Solving Problem: An electric mixer does 2500 joules of work in 5 seconds. What is its power? Solution: Use the equation: Power = Work Time . Power = 2500 J = 500 J/s, or 500 W 5s You Try It! Problem: How much work can be done in 30 seconds by a 1000-watt microwave? ",
      "topic_T_3634": "Sometimes power is measured in a unit called the horsepower. One horsepower is the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute. It equals 745 watts of power. The horsepower was introduced by James Watt, who invented the first powerful steam engine in the 1770s. Watts steam engine led to a revolution in industry and agriculture because of its power. Watt wanted to impress people with the power of his steam engine, so he compared it with something familiar to people of his time: the power of workhorses, like those pictured in Figure 16.6. Watt said his steam engine could produce the power of 20 horses, or 20 horsepower. The most powerful engines today may produce more than 100,000 horsepower! How many watts of power is that? ",

      "topic_T_3403": "The muscular system consists of all the muscles in the body. This is the body system that allows us to move. You also depend on many muscles to keep you alive. Your heart, which is mostly muscle, pumps blood around your body. Each muscle in the body is made up of cells called muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are long, thin cells that can do something that other cells cannot dothey are able to get shorter. Shortening of muscle fibers is called contraction. Muscle fibers can contract because they are made of proteins, called actin and myosin, that form long filaments (or fibers). When muscles contract, these protein filaments slide or glide past one another, shortening the length of the cell. When your muscles relax, the length extends back to the previous position. Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction. You can control some muscle movements. However, certain muscle movements happen without you thinking about them. Muscles that are under your conscious control are called voluntary muscles. Muscles that are not under your conscious control are called involuntary muscles. Muscle tissue is one of the four types of tissue found in animals. There are three different types of muscle in the body ( Figure 1.1): 1. Skeletal muscle is made up of voluntary muscles, usually attached to the skeleton. Skeletal muscles move the body. They can also contract involuntarily by reflexes. For example, you can choose to move your arm, but your arm would move automatically if you were to burn your finger on a stove top. This voluntary contraction begins with a thought process. A signal from your brain tells your muscles to contract or relax. Quickly contract and relax the muscles in your fingers a few times. Think about how quickly these signals must travel throughout your body to make this happen. 2. Smooth muscle is composed of involuntary muscles found within the walls of organs and structures such as the esophagus, stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. These muscles push materials like food or blood through organs. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle can never be under your control. 3. Cardiac muscle is also an involuntary muscle, found only in the heart. The cardiac muscle fibers all contract together, generating enough force to push blood throughout the body. What would happen if this muscle was under conscious or voluntary control? There are three types of muscles in the body: cardiac, skeletal, and smooth. ",

In the case of females, however, the gametes are eggs, and they are produced by the ovaries. The hormone is estrogen, which is the main sex hormone in females. Estrogen has two major roles: During adolescence, estrogen causes the changes of puberty. It causes the reproductive organs to mature. It also causes other female traits to develop. For example, it causes the breasts to grow and the hips to widen. During adulthood, estrogen is needed for a woman to release eggs from the ovaries. The female reproductive system has another important function, which is not found in males. It supports a baby as it develops before birth. It also gives birth to the baby at the end of pregnancy. ",
      "topic_T_2333": "The female reproductive organs include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. These organs are shown in Figure 22.3, along with some other structures of the female reproductive system. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it below. For a cartoon about the female reproductive system, watch this video: http://education-por The two ovaries are small, oval organs on either side of the abdomen. Each ovary contains thousands of eggs. However, the eggs do not develop fully until a female has gone through puberty. Then, about once a month, an egg is released by one of the ovaries. The ovaries also secrete estrogen. The two fallopian tubes are thin tubes that are connected to the uterus and extend almost to the ovaries. The upper end of each fallopian tube has fingers (called fimbriae) that sweep an egg into the fallopian tube when it is released by the ovary. The egg then passes through the fallopian tube to the uterus. If an egg is fertilized, this occurs in the fallopian tube. The uterus is a hollow organ with muscular walls. The uterus is where a baby develops until birth. The walls of the uterus stretch to accommodate the growing fetus. The muscles in the walls contract to push the baby out during birth. The uterus is connected to the vagina by a small opening called the cervix. The vagina is a cylinder-shaped organ that opens to the outside of the body. The other end joins with the uterus. Sperm deposited in the vagina swim up through the cervix, into the uterus, and from there into a ",
      "topic_T_2334": "When a baby girl is born, her ovaries contain all of the eggs they will ever produce. But these eggs are not fully developed. They develop only after the female reaches puberty at about age 12 or 13. Then, just one egg develops each month until she reaches her 40s or early 50s. ",
      "topic_T_2335": "Human eggs are very large cells. In fact, they are the largest of all human cells. You can even see an egg without a microscope. Its almost as big as the period at the end of this sentence. Like a sperm cell, an egg cell is a haploid cell with half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg lacks a tail and contains a lot of cytoplasm. ",
      "topic_T_2336": "Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It occurs in several steps: 1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis to make identical daughter cells. 2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. However, they go though only the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at this time. They remain in that stage until the girl goes through puberty. 3. After puberty, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. As you can see in Figure 22.4, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. 4. After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation. After ovulation occurs, the moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube sweep the egg into the tube. Fertilization may occur if sperm reach the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. If this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that differ in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the fertilized egg, which will develop into a new human being. ",
      "topic_T_2337": "Egg production in the ovary is part of the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is a series of changes in the reproductive system of mature females that repeats every month on average. These changes include the development of an egg and follicle in the ovary. While the egg is developing, other changes are taking place in the uterus. It develops a thick lining that is full of tiny blood vessels. The lining prepares the uterus to receive a fertilized egg if fertilization actually takes place. If fertilization doesnt occur, the egg passes through the uterus and vagina and out of the body. The lining of the uterus also breaks down. Blood and other tissues from the lining pass through the vagina and leave the body. This is called menstruation. Menstruation is also called a menstrual period. It typically lasts about 4 days. When the menstrual period ends, the cycle begins repeats. ",

Or you could use a point of reference. If you want to meet up with a friend, you could tell him the distance and direction you are from the reference point. An example is, I am at the corner of Maple Street and Main Street, about two blocks north of your apartment. When studying Earths surface, scientists must be able to pinpoint a feature they are interested in. Scientists and others have a system to describe the location of any feature. Usually they use latitude and longitude as a coordinate system. Lines of latitude and longitude form a grid. The grid is centered on a reference point. You will learn about this type of grid when we discuss maps later in this chapter. ",
      "topic_T_0370": "When an object is moving, it is not enough to describe its location. We also need to know direction. Direction is important for describing moving objects. For example, a wind blows a storm over your school. Where is that storm coming from? Where is it going? The most common way to describe direction is by using a compass. A compass is a device with a floating needle (Figure 2.1). The needle is a small magnet that aligns itself with the Earths magnetic field. The compass needle always points to magnetic north. If you have a compass and you find north, you can then know any other direction. See the directions, such as east, south, west, etc., on a compass rose. A compass needle lines up with Earths magnetic north pole. This is different from Earths geographic north pole, or true north. The geographic north pole is the top of the imaginary axis around which Earth rotates. The geographic north pole is much like the spindle of a spinning top. The location of the geographic north pole does not change. However, the magnetic north pole shifts in location over time. Depending on where you live, you can correct for the difference between the two poles when you use a map and a compass (Figure 2.2). Some maps have a double compass rose. This allows users to make the corrections between magnetic north and true north. An example is a nautical chart that boaters use to chart their positions at sea (Figure 2.3). ",
      "topic_T_0371": "As you know, the surface of Earth is not flat. Some places are high and some places are low. For example, mountain ranges like the Sierra Nevada in California or the Andes in South America are high above the surrounding areas. We can describe the topography of a region by measuring the height or depth of that feature relative to sea level (Figure mountains, while others are more like small hills! Relief, or terrain, includes all the landforms of a region. A topographic map shows the height, or elevation, of features in an area. This includes mountains, craters, valleys, and rivers. For example, Figure 2.5 shows the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona. Features on the map include mountains, hills and lava flows. You can recognize these features from the differences in elevation. We will talk about some different landforms in the next section. ",
      "topic_T_0372": "If you take away the water in the oceans (Figure 2.6), Earth looks really different. You see that the surface has two main features: continents and ocean basins. Continents are large land areas. Ocean basins extend from the edges of continents to the ocean floor and into deep trenches. Continents are much older than ocean basins. Some rocks on the continents are billions of years old. Ocean basins are only millions of years old at their oldest. Because the continents are so old, a lot has happened to them! As we view the land around us we see landforms. Landforms are physical features on Earths surface. Landforms are introduced in this section but will be discussed more in later chapters. Constructive forces cause landforms to grow. Lava flowing into the ocean can build land outward. A volcano can be a constructive force. Destructive forces may blow landforms apart. A volcano blowing its top off is a destructive force. The destructive forces of weathering and erosion change landforms more slowly. Over millions of years, mountains are worn down by rivers and streams. Constructive and destructive forces work together to create landforms. Constructive forces create mountains and erosion may wear them away. Mountains are very large landforms. Mountains may wear away into a high flat area called a plateau, or a lower-lying plain. Interior plains are in the middle of continents. Coastal plains are on the edge of a continent, where it meets the ocean. Rivers and streams flow across continents. They cut away at rock, forming river valleys (Figure 2.8). These are ",
      "topic_T_0373": "The ocean basin begins where the ocean meets the land. The continental margin begins at the shore and goes down to the ocean floor. It includes the continental shelf, slope, and rise. The continental shelf is part of the continent, but it is underwater today. It is about 100-200 meters deep, much shallower than the rest of the ocean. The continental shelf usually goes out about 100 to 200 kilometers from the shore (Figure 2.9). The continental slope is the slope that forms the edge of the continent. It is seaward of the continental shelf. In some places, a large pile of sediments brought from rivers creates the continental rise. The continental rise ends at the Besides seamounts, there are long, very tall (about 2 km) mountain ranges. These ranges are connected so that they form huge ridge systems called mid-ocean ridges (Figure 2.11). The mid-ocean ridges form from volcanic eruptions. Lava from inside Earth breaks through the crust and creates the mountains. The deepest places of the ocean are the ocean trenches. Many trenches line the edges of the Pacific Ocean. The Mariana Trench is the deepest place in the ocean. (Figure 2.12). At about 11 km deep, it is the deepest place on Earth! To compare, the tallest place on Earth, Mount Everest, is less than 9 km tall. ",

Diamond is the hardest natural substance. It is used for cutting and grinding tools as well as for rings and other pieces of jewelry. Graphite Graphite is a form of carbon in which carbon atoms are arranged in layers. Bonds are strong between carbon atoms within each layer but relatively weak between atoms in different layers.

Summer temperatures are high; winters are cooler and longer than in tropical moist climates. Rainfall: Irregular; several years of drought are often followed by a single year of abundant rainfall. Dry climates cover about 26% of the worlds land area. Low latitude deserts are found at the Ferrell cell high pressure zone. Higher latitude deserts occur within continents or in rainshadows. Vegetation is sparse but well adapted to the dry conditions. ",
      "topic_T_1002": "Moist subtropical mid-latitude climates are found along the coastal areas in the United States. Temperature: The coldest month ranges from just below freezing to almost balmy, between -3o C and 18o C (27o to 64o F). Summers are mild, with average temperatures above 10o C (50o F). Seasons are distinct. Rainfall: There is plentiful annual rainfall. ",
      "topic_T_1003": "Continental climates are found in most of the North American interior from about 40 N to 70 N. Temperature: The average temperature of the warmest month is higher than 10 C (50 F) and the coldest month is below -3 C (27 F). Precipitation: Winters are cold and stormy (look at the latitude of this zone and see if you can figure out why). Snowfall is common and snow stays on the ground for long periods of time. Trees grow in continental climates, even though winters are extremely cold, because the average annual temperature is fairly mild. Continental climates are not found in the Southern Hemisphere because of the absence of a continent large enough to generate this effect. ",
      "topic_T_1004": "Polar climates are found across the continents that border the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, and Antarctica. Temperature: Winters are entirely dark and bitterly cold. Summer days are long, but the Sun is low on the horizon so summers are cool. The average temperature of the warmest month is less than 10o C (50o F). The annual temperature range is large. Precipitation: The region is dry, with less than 25 cm (10 inches) of precipitation annually; most precipitation occurs during the summer. ",
      "topic_T_1005": "When climate conditions in a small area are different from those of the surroundings, the climate of the small area is called a microclimate. The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings since cold air sinks. The ground surface may be hotter or colder than the air a few feet above it, because rock and soil gain and lose heat readily. Different sides of a mountain will have different microclimates. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing slope receives more solar energy than a north-facing slope, so each side supports different amounts and types of vegetation. Altitude mimics latitude in climate zones. Climates and biomes typical of higher latitudes may be found in other areas of the world at high altitudes. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

      "topic_T_3623": "Buoyancy is the ability of a fluid to exert an upward force on any object placed in the fluid. This upward force is called buoyant force. ",
      "topic_T_3624": "What explains buoyant force? Recall from the earlier lesson \"Pressure of Fluids\" that a fluid exerts pressure in all directions but the pressure is greater at greater depth. Therefore, the fluid below an object exerts greater force on the object than the fluid above the object. This is illustrated in Figure 15.12. Buoyant force explains why objects may float in water. No doubt youve noticed, however, that some objects do not float in water. If buoyant force applies to all objects in fluids, why do some objects sink instead of float? The answer has to do with their weight. ",
      "topic_T_3625": "Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object. Buoyant force pushes up on an object. Weight and buoyant force together determine whether an object sinks or floats. This is illustrated in Figure 15.13. If an objects weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on the object, then the object floats. This is the example on the left in Figure 15.13. If an objects weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on the object, then the object sinks. This is the example on the right in Figure 15.13. Because of buoyant force, objects seem lighter in water. You may have noticed this when you went swimming and could easily pick up a friend or sibling under the water. Some of the persons weight was countered by the buoyant force of the water. ",
      "topic_T_3626": "Density, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to buoyancy. Thats because density affects weight. A given volume of a denser substance is heavier than the same volume of a less dense substance. For example, ice is less dense than liquid water. This explains why ice cubes float in a glass of water. This and other examples of density and buoyant force are illustrated in Figure 15.14 and in the video at this URL:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: ",
      "topic_T_3627": "Did you ever notice that when you get into a bathtub of water the level of the water rises? More than 2200 years ago, a Greek mathematician named Archimedes noticed the same thing. He observed that both a body and the water in a tub cant occupy the same space at the same time. As a result, some of the water is displaced, or moved out of the way. How much water is displaced? Archimedes determined that the volume of displaced water equals the volume of the submerged object. So more water is displaced by a bigger body than a smaller one. What does displacement have to do with buoyant force? Everything! Archimedes discovered that the buoyant force acting on an object in a fluid equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is known as Archimedes law (or Archimedes Principle). Archimedes law explains why some objects float in fluids even though they are very heavy. Remember the oil tanker that opened this chapter? It is extremely heavy, yet it stays afloat. If a steel ball with the same weight as the ship were put into water, it would sink to the bottom (see Figure 15.15). Thats because the volume of water displaced by the steel ball weighs less than the ball. As a result, the buoyant force is not as great as the force of gravity acting on the ball. The design of the ships hull, on the other hand, causes it to displace much more water than the ball. In fact, the weight of the displaced water is greater than the weight of the ship, so the buoyant force is greater than the force of gravity acting on the ship. As a result, the ship floats.

Plasma is superheated gas with an electrical charge. Because the Sun is made of gases, it does not have a defined outer boundary. Like Earth, the Sun has an internal structure. The inner three layers make up what we would actually call the Sun. ",
      "topic_T_0538": "The core is the Suns innermost layer. The core is plasma. It has a temperature of around 15 million degrees Celsius (C). Nuclear fusion reactions create the immense temperature. In these reactions, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium. This releases vast amounts of energy. The energy moves towards the outer layers of the Sun. Energy from the Suns core powers most of the solar system. ",
      "topic_T_0539": "The radiative zone is the next layer out. It has a temperature of about 4 million degrees C. Energy from the core travels through the radiative zone. The rate the energy travels is extremely slow. Light particles, called photons, can only travel a few millimeters before they hit another particle. The particles are absorbed and then released again. It may take 50 million years for a photon to travel all the way through the radiative zone. ",
      "topic_T_0540": "The convection zone surrounds the radiative zone. In the convection zone, hot material from near the Suns center rises. This material cools at the surface, and then plunges back downward. The material then receives more heat from the radiative zone. ",

      "topic_T_0542": "The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun (Figure 24.17). Its the part that we see shining. Surprisingly, the photosphere is also one of the coolest layers of the Sun. It is only about 6000 degrees C. ",
      "topic_T_0543": "The chromosphere lies above the photosphere. It is about 2,000 km thick. The thin chromosphere is heated by energy from the photosphere. Temperatures range from about 4000 degrees C to about 10,000 degrees C. The chromosphere is not as hot as other parts of the Sun, and it glows red. Jets of gas sometimes fly up through the chromosphere. With speeds up to 72,000 km per hour, the jets can fly as high as 10,000 kilometers. ",
      "topic_T_0544": "The corona is the outermost part of the Suns atmosphere. It is the Suns halo, or crown. With a temperature of 1 to 3 million K, the corona is much hotter than the photosphere. The corona extends millions of kilometers into space. Sometime you should try to see a total solar eclipse. If you do you will see the Suns corona shining out into space. ",

      "topic_T_0546": "The most noticeable magnetic activity of the Sun is the appearance of sunspots. Sunspots are cooler, darker areas on the Suns surface (Figure 24.18). Sunspots occur in an 11 year cycle. The number of sunspots begins at a minimum. The number gradually increases to the maximum. Then the number returns to a minimum again. Sunspots form because loops of the Suns magnetic field break through the surface. Sunspots usually occur in pairs. The loop breaks through the surface where it comes out of the Sun. It breaks through again where it goes back into the Sun. Sunspots disrupt the transfer of heat from the Suns lower layers. ",
      "topic_T_0547": "A loop of the Suns magnetic field may break. This creates solar flares. Solar flares are violent explosions that release huge amounts of energy (Figure 24.19). The streams of high energy particles they emit make up the solar wind. Solar wind is dangerous to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar flares can even cause damage on Earth. They have knocked out entire power grids and can disturb radio, satellite, and cell phone communications. ",
      "topic_T_0548": "Another amazing feature on the Sun is solar prominences. Plasma flows along the loop that connects sunspots. This plasma forms a glowing arch. The arch is a solar prominence. Solar prominences can reach thousands of kilometers into the Suns atmosphere. Prominences can last for a day to several months. Prominences can be seen during a total solar eclipse. NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on February 11, 2010. SDO is studying the Suns magnetic field. This includes how the Sun affects Earths atmosphere and climate.

      "topic_T_2613": "Figure 7.17 shows the history of Earth in a day. In this model, the planet forms at midnight. The first prokaryotes evolve around 3:00 am. Eukaryotes evolve at about 1:00 pm. Animals dont evolve until almost 8:00 pm. Humans appear only in the last minute of the day. Relating these major events in Earths history to a 24-hour day helps to put them in perspective. ",
      "topic_T_2614": "Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the geologic time scale. You can see this time scale in Figure 7.18. It divides Earths history into eons, eras, and periods. These divisions are based on major changes in geology, climate, and the evolution of life. The geologic time scale organizes Earths history on the basis of important events instead of time alone. It also puts more focus on recent events, about which we know the most. ",
      "topic_T_2615": "The Precambrian Supereon is the first major division of Earths history (see Figure 7.18). It covers the time from Earths formation 4.6 billion years ago to 544 million years ago. To see how life evolved during the Precambrian and beyond, watch this wonderful video. Its a good introduction to the rest of the lesson. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: ",
      "topic_T_2616": "When Earth first formed, it was a fiery hot, barren ball. It had no oceans or atmosphere. Rivers of melted rock flowed over its surface. Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. Gases from volcanoes formed an atmosphere, although it contained only a trace of oxygen. As the planet continued to cool, clouds formed and rain fell. Rainwater helped form oceans. The ancient atmosphere and oceans would be toxic to modern life, but they set the stage for life to begin. ",
      "topic_T_2617": "All living things consist of organic molecules. Many scientists think that organic molecules evolved before cells, perhaps as early as 4 billion years ago. Its possible that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earths early atmosphere. This could have created a soup of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. Some scientists think that RNA was the first organic molecule to evolve. RNA can not only encode genetic instructions. Some RNA molecules can carry out chemical reactions. All living things are made of one or more cells. How the first cells evolved is not known for certain. Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around RNA molecules. The earliest cells may have consisted of little more than RNA inside a lipid membrane. You can see a model of such a cell in Figure 7.19. The first cells probably evolved between 3.8 and 4 billion years ago. Scientists think that one cell, called the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all of the following life on Earth. LUCA may have existed around 3.5 billion years ago. ",
      "topic_T_2618": "The earliest cells were heterotrophs. They were unable to make food. Instead, they got energy by \"eating\" organic molecules in the soup around them. The earliest cells were also prokaryotes. They lacked a nucleus and other organelles. Gradually, these and other traits evolved. Photosynthesis evolved about 3 billion years ago. After that, certain cells could use sunlight to make food. These were the first autotrophs. They made food for themselves and other cells. They also added oxygen to the atmosphere. The oxygen was a waste product of photosynthesis. Oxygen was toxic to many cells. They had evolved in its absence. Many of them died out. The few that survived evolved a new way to use oxygen. They used it to get energy from food. This is the process of cellular respiration. The first eukaryotic cells probably evolved about 2 billion years ago. Thats when cells evolved organelles and a nucleus. Figure 7.20 shows one theory about the origin of organelles. According to this theory, a large cell engulfed small cells. The small cells took on special roles that helped the large cell function. In return, the small cells got nutrients from the large cell. Eventually, the large and small cells could no longer live apart. With their specialized organelles, eukaryotic cells were powerful and efficient. Eukaryotes would go on to evolve sexual reproduction. They would also evolve into multicellular organisms. The first multicellular organisms evolved about 1 billion years ago. ",
      "topic_T_2619": "At the end of the Precambrian, a mass extinction occurred. In a mass extinction, the majority of species die out. The Precambrian mass extinction was the first of six mass extinctions that occurred on Earth. Its not certain what caused this first mass extinction. Changes in Earths geology and climate were no doubt involved. ",
      "topic_T_2620": "The Paleozoic Era lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago. It is divided into six periods. ",
      "topic_T_2621": "The Precambrian mass extinction opened up many niches for new organisms to fill. As a result, the Cambrian Period began with an explosion of new kinds of living things. For example, many types of simple animals called sponges evolved. Trilobites were also very common. Sponges and trilobites were small ocean invertebrates. These are animals without a backbone. You can see examples of them in Figure 7.21. ",
      "topic_T_2622": "During the Ordovician Period, the oceans became filled with many kinds of invertebrates. The first fish also evolved. Plants colonized the land for the first time. However, animals remained in the water. ",
      "topic_T_2623": "Corals appeared in the oceans during the Silurian period. Fish continued to evolve. On land, vascular plants appeared. These are plants that have special tissues to circulate water and other substances. This allowed plants to become larger and colonize drier habitats. ",
      "topic_T_2624": "During the Devonian Period, the first seed plants evolved. Seeds have a protective coat and contain stored food. This was a big advantage over other types of plant reproduction. Seed plants eventually became the most common type of plants on land. In the oceans, fish with lobe fins evolved. These fish could breathe air when they raised their head above water. This was a step in the evolution of animals that could live on land. ",
      "topic_T_2625": "In the Carboniferous Period, forests of huge ferns and trees were widespread. You can see how these first forests might have looked in Figure 7.22. After the ferns and trees died, their remains eventually turned to coal. The first amphibians also evolved during this period. They could live on land but had to return to the water to lay their eggs. After amphibians, the earliest reptiles appeared. They were the first animals that could reproduce on land and move away from the water. ",
      "topic_T_2626": "During the Permian Period, all the major landmasses moved together to form one supercontinent. The supercontinent has been named Pangaea. You can see how it looked in Figure 7.23. At this time, temperatures were extreme and the climate became very dry. As a result, plants and animals evolved ways to cope with dryness. For example, reptiles evolved leathery skin. This helped prevent water loss. Plants evolved waxy leaves for the same purpose. The Permian Period ended with Earths second mass extinction. During this event, most of Earths species went extinct. It was the most massive extinction ever recorded. Its not clear why it happened. One possible reason is that a very large meteorite struck Earth. Another possibility is the eruption of enormous volcanoes. Either event could create a huge amount of dust. The dust might block out sunlight for months. This would cool the planet and prevent photosynthesis. ",
      "topic_T_2627": "The Permian mass extinction paved the way for another burst of new life at the start of the Mesozoic Era. This era is known as the age of dinosaurs. It is divided into three periods. ",
      "topic_T_2628": "During the Triassic Period, the first dinosaurs evolved from reptile ancestors. They eventually colonized the air and water in addition to the land. There were also forests of huge seed ferns and cone-bearing conifer trees in the Triassic Period. Modern corals, fish, and insects all evolved in this period as well. The supercontinent of Pangea started to break up. The Triassic Period ended in a mass extinction. The majority of species died out, but dinosaurs were spared. ",
      "topic_T_2629": "The Triassic mass extinction gave dinosaurs the opportunity to really flourish during the Jurassic Period. Thats why this period is called the golden age of dinosaurs. The earliest birds also evolved during the Jurassic from dinosaur ancestors. In addition, all the major groups of mammals appeared. Flowering plants also appeared for the first time. New insects evolved to pollinate them. The continents continued to move apart. ",
      "topic_T_2630": "During the Cretaceous Period, the dinosaurs reached their maximum size and distribution. For example, the well- known Tyrannosaurus rex weighed at least 7 tons! You can get an idea of how big it was from the T. rex skeleton in Figure 7.24. (Notice how small the person looks in the bottom left of the photo.) By the end of the Cretaceous, the continents were close to their present locations. The period ended with another mass extinction. This time, the dinosaurs went extinct. What happened to the dinosaurs? Some scientists think that a comet or asteroid may have crashed into Earth. This could darken the sky, shut down photosynthesis, and cause climate change. Other factors probably contributed to the mass extinction as well. ",
      "topic_T_2631": "The extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era paved the way for mammals to take over. Thats why the Cenozoic Era is called the age of mammals. They soon became the dominant land animals on Earth. The Cenozoic is divided into two periods. ",
      "topic_T_2632": "During the Tertiary Period, many new kinds of mammals evolved. For example, primates and human ancestors first appeared during this period. Many mammals also increased in size. Modern rain forests and grasslands appeared. Flowering plants and insects increased in numbers. ",
      "topic_T_2633": "During the Quaternary Period, the climate cooled. This caused a series of ice ages. Glaciers advanced southward from the North Pole. They reached as far south as Chicago and New York City. Sea levels fell because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This exposed land bridges between continents. The land bridges allowed land animals to move to new areas. Some mammals adapted to the cold by evolving very large size and thick fur. An example is the woolly mammoth, shown in Figure 7.25. Other mammals moved closer to the equator. Those that couldnt adapt or move went extinct, along with many plants. The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. By then, our own species, Homo sapiens, had evolved. After that, we were eyewitnesses to the story of life. As a result, the recent past is less of a mystery than the billions of years before it. ",

The Precambrian ended with the first of six mass extinctions that occurred during Earths history. The Paleozoic Era (544245 million years ago) started with an explosion of new kinds of organisms. Major evolutionary events during this era included the first appearance of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Plants also colonized the land, and vascular plants and seed plants evolved. The era ended with the Permian mass extinction. The Mesozoic Era (24565 million years ago) is called the age of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs evolved from reptiles. They flourished after the Triassic mass extinction. They went extinct at the end of the era in the Cretaceous mass extinction. Birds and flowering plants also first appeared during the Mesozoic Era. The Cenozoic Era (65 million years agopresent) is called the age of mammals. Mammals became more diverse, and many increased in size. A series of ice ages affected the evolution of living things during this era. The human species evolved toward the end of the Mesozoic Era. ",

      "topic_T_3561": "Speed is an important aspect of motion. It is a measure of how fast or slow something moves. It depends on how far something travels and how long it takes to travel that far. Speed can be calculated using this general formula: speed = distance time A familiar example is the speed of a car. In the U.S., this is usually expressed in miles per hour (see Figure 12.6). If your family makes a car trip that covers 120 miles and takes 3 hours, then the cars speed is: speed = 120 mi = 40 mi/h 3h The speed of a car may also be expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h). The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s). ",
      "topic_T_3562": "When you travel by car, you usually dont move at a constant speed. Instead you go faster or slower depending on speed limits, traffic, traffic lights, and many other factors. For example, you might travel 65 miles per hour on a highway but only 20 miles per hour on a city street (see Figure 12.7). You might come to a complete stop at traffic lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to pass other cars. The speed of a moving car or other object at a given instant is called its instantaneous speed. It may vary from moment to moment, so it is hard to calculate. Its easier to calculate the average speed of a moving object than the instantaneous speed. The average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time it took to travel that distance. To calculate the average speed, you can use the general formula for speed that was given above. Suppose, for example, that you took a 75-mile car trip with your family. Your instantaneous speed would vary throughout the trip. If the trip took a total of 1.5 hours, your average speed for the trip would be: average speed = 75 mi = 50 mi/h 1.5 h You can see a video about instantaneous and average speed and how to calculate them at this URL:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

A distance-time graph shows how the distance from the starting point changes over time. The graph in Figure 12.8 represents a bike trip. The trip began at 7:30 AM (A) and ended at 12:30 PM (F). The rider traveled from the starting point to a destination and then returned to the starting point again. ",
      "topic_T_3564": "In a distance-time graph, the speed of the object is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line. If the line is straight, like the line between A and B in Figure 12.8, then the speed is constant. The average speed can be calculated from the graph. The change in distance (represented by Dd) divided by the change in time (represented by Dt): speed = Dd Dt For example, the speed between A and B in Figure 12.8 is: speed = Dd 20 km 0 km 20 km = = = 20 km/h Dt 8:30 7:30 h 1h If the graph line is horizontal, as it is between B and C, then the slope and the speed are zero: speed = Dd 20 km 20 km 0 km = = = 0 km/h Dt 9:00 8:30 h 0.5 h You Try It!

To do so, you would use this version of the general speed formula: distance = speed  time For example, if a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then the distance traveled is: distance = 60 km/h  2 h = 120 km You Try It!

Water inhabits reservoirs within the cycle, such as ponds, oceans, or the atmosphere. The molecules move between these reservoirs by certain processes, including condensation and precipitation. There are only so many water molecules and these molecules cycle around. If climate cools and glaciers and ice caps grow, there is less water for the oceans and sea level will fall. The reverse can also happen. The following section looks at the reservoirs and the processes that move water between them. ",
      "topic_T_1592": "The Sun, many millions of kilometers away, provides the energy that drives the water cycle. Our nearest star directly impacts the water cycle by supplying the energy needed for evaporation. ",

      "topic_T_1594": "Water changes from a liquid to a gas by evaporation to become water vapor. The Suns energy can evaporate water from the ocean surface or from lakes, streams, or puddles on land. Only the water molecules evaporate; the salts remain in the ocean or a fresh water reservoir. The water vapor remains in the atmosphere until it undergoes condensation to become tiny droplets of liquid. The droplets gather in clouds, which are blown about the globe by wind. As the water droplets in the clouds collide and grow, they fall from the sky as precipitation. Precipitation can be rain, sleet, hail, or snow. Sometimes precipitation falls back into the ocean and sometimes it falls onto the land surface. ",
      "topic_T_1595": "When water falls from the sky as rain it may enter streams and rivers that flow downward to oceans and lakes. Water that falls as snow may sit on a mountain for several months. Snow may become part of the ice in a glacier, where it may remain for hundreds or thousands of years. Snow and ice may go directly back into the air by sublimation, the process in which a solid changes directly into a gas without first becoming a liquid. Although you probably have not seen water vapor undergoing sublimation from a glacier, you may have seen dry ice sublimate in air. Snow and ice slowly melt over time to become liquid water, which provides a steady flow of fresh water to streams, rivers, and lakes below. A water droplet falling as rain could also become part of a stream or a lake. At the surface, the water may eventually evaporate and reenter the atmosphere. ",

The device is propelled by particles flying out of it at high speed in the other direction. There are records of the Chinese using rockets in war against the Mongols as early as the 13th century. The Mongols then used rockets to attack Eastern Europe. Early rockets were also used to launch fireworks. ",
      "topic_T_0500": "Rockets were used for centuries before anyone could explain how they worked. The theory came about in 1687. Isaac Newton (16431727) described three basic laws of motion, now referred to as Newtons Laws of Motion: 1. An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by a force. 2. Force equals mass multiplied by acceleration. 3. To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Which of these three best explains how a rocket works? Newtons third law of motion. When a rockets propulsion pushes in one direction, the rocket moves in the opposite direction, as seen in the Figure 23.12. For a long time, many people believed that a rocket wouldnt work in space. There would be nothing for the rocket to push against. But they do work! Fuel is ignited in a chamber. The gases in the chamber explode. The explosion creates pressure that forces the gases out of one side of the rocket. The rocket moves in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 23.13. The force pushing the rocket is called thrust. ",
      "topic_T_0501": "For centuries, rockets were powered by gunpowder or other solid fuels. These rockets could travel only short distances. Around the turn of the 20th century, several breakthroughs took place. These breakthroughs led to rockets that could travel beyond Earth. Liquid fuel gave rockets enough power to escape Earths gravity (Figure 23.14). By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher. Rockets were used during World War II. The V2 was the first human-made object to travel high enough to be considered in space (Figure 23.15). Its altitude was 176 km (109 miles) above Earths surface. Wernher von Braun was a German rocket scientist. After he fled Germany in WWII, he helped the United States develop missile weapons. After the war, von Braun worked for NASA. He designed the Saturn V rocket (Figure ",
      "topic_T_0502": "One of the first uses of rockets in space was to launch satellites. A satellite is an object that orbits a larger object. An orbit is a circular or elliptical path around an object. Natural objects in orbit are called natural satellites. The Moon is a natural satellite. Human-made objects in orbit are called artificial satellites. There are more and more artificial satellites orbiting Earth all the time. They all get into space using some sort of rocket. ",
      "topic_T_0503": "Why do satellites stay in orbit? Why dont they crash into Earth due to the planets gravity? Newtons law of universal gravitation describes what happens. Every object in the universe is attracted to every other object. Gravity makes an apple fall to the ground. Gravity also keeps you from floating away into the sky. Gravity holds the Moon in orbit around Earth. It keeps Earth in orbit around the Sun. Newton used an example to explain how gravity makes orbiting possible. Imagine a cannonball launched from a high mountain, as shown in Figure 23.17. If the cannonball is launched at a slow speed, it will fall back to Earth. This is shown as paths (A) and (B). Something different happens if the cannonball is launched at a fast speed. The Earth below curves away at the same rate that the cannonball falls. The cannonball then goes into a circular orbit, as in path (C). If the cannonball is launched even faster, it could go into an elliptical orbit (D). It might even leave Earths gravity and go into space (E). Unfortunately, Newtons idea would not work in real life. A cannonball launched at a fast speed from Mt. Everest would not go into orbit. The cannonball would burn up in the atmosphere. However, a rocket can launch straight up, then steer into orbit. It wont burn up in the orbit. A rocket can carry a satellite above the atmosphere and then release the satellite into orbit. ",

These include the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Satellites have many different purposes. Imaging satellites take pictures Earths surface. These images are used for military or scientific purposes. Astronomers use imaging satellites to study and make maps of the Moon and other planets. Communications satellites, such as the one in Figure 23.18, are now extremely common. These satellites receive and send signals for telephone, television, or other types of communications. Navigational satellites are used for navigation systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). The largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station. The ISS is designed for humans to live in space while conducting scientific research. ",

Other satellites study the oceans, atmosphere, polar ice sheets, and other Earth systems. This data helps us to monitor climate change. Other long-term changes in the planet are also best seen from space. Satellite images help scientists understand how Earths systems affect one another. Different satellites monitor different wavelengths of energy, as in Figure 23.19. ",
      "topic_T_0506": "Satellites have different views depending on their orbit. Satellites may be put in a low orbit. These satellites orbit from north to south over the poles. These satellites view a different part of Earth each time they circle. Imaging and weather satellites need this type of view. Satellite may be placed so that they orbit at the same rate the Earth spins. The satellite then remains over the same location on the surface. Communications satellites are often placed in these orbits. ",

Sputnik 1, shown in Figure 23.20, sent out radio signals, which were detected by scientists and amateur radio operators around the world. The satellite stayed in orbit for about 3 months, until it burned up as a result of friction with Earths atmosphere. The launch of Sputnik 1 started the Space Race between the USSR and the USA. Americans were shocked that the Soviets had the technology to put the satellite into orbit. They worried that the Soviets might also be winning the arms race.

A map is a picture of specific parts of Earths surface. There are many types of maps. Each map gives us different information. Lets look at a road map, which is the probably the most common map that you use (Figure 2.13). ",
      "topic_T_0375": "Look for the legend on the top left side of the map. It explains how this map records different features. You can see the following: The boundaries of the state show its shape. Black dots represent the cities. Each city is named. The size of the dot represents the population of the city. Red and brown lines show major roads that connect the cities. Blue lines show rivers. Their names are written in blue. Blue areas show lakes and other waterways the Gulf of Mexico, Biscayne Bay, and Lake Okeechobee. Names for bodies of water are also written in blue. A line or scale of miles shows the distance represented on the map an inch or centimeter on the map represents a certain amount of distance (miles or kilometers). The legend explains other features and symbols on the map. It is the convention for north to be at the top of a map. For this reason, a compass rose is not needed on most maps. You can use this map to find your way around Florida and get from one place to another along roadways. ",
      "topic_T_0376": "There are many other types of maps besides road maps. Some examples include: Political or geographic maps show the outlines and borders of states and/or countries. Satellite view maps show terrains and vegetation forests, deserts, and mountains. Relief maps show elevations of areas, but usually on a larger scale, such as the whole Earth, rather than a local area. Topographic maps show detailed elevations of features on the map. Climate maps show average temperatures and rainfall. Precipitation maps show the amount of rainfall in different areas. Weather maps show storms, air masses, and fronts. Radar maps show storms and rainfall. Geologic maps detail the types and locations of rocks found in an area. These are but a few types of maps that various Earth scientists might use. You can easily carry a map around in your pocket or bag. Maps are easy to use because they are flat or two-dimensional. However, the world is three- dimensional. So, how do map makers represent a three-dimensional world on flat paper? ",
      "topic_T_0377": "Earth is a round, three-dimensional ball. In a small area, Earth looks flat, so it is not hard to make accurate maps of a small place. When map makers want to map the round Earth on flat paper, they use projections. What happens if you try to flatten out the skin of a peeled orange? Or if you try to gift wrap a soccer ball? To flatten out, the orange peel must rip and its shape must become distorted. To wrap around object with flat paper requires lots of extra cuts and folds. A projection is a way to represent Earths curved surface on flat paper (Figure 2.14). There are many types of projections. Each uses a different way to change three dimensions into two dimensions. There are two basic methods that the map maker uses in projections: The map maker slices the sphere in some way and unfolds it to make a flat map, like flattening out an orange peel. The map maker can look at the sphere from a certain point and then translate this view onto a flat paper. Lets look at a few commonly used projections. ",
      "topic_T_0378": "In 1569, Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594) (Figure 2.15) figured out a way to make a flat map of our round world, called the Mercator projection (Figure 2.16). Imagine wrapping the round, ball-shaped Earth with a big, flat piece of paper. First you make a tube or a cylinder. The cylinder will touch Earth at its fattest part, the equator. The equator is the imaginary line running horizontally around the middle of Earth. The poles are the farthest points from the cylinder. If you shine a light from the inside of your model Earth out to the cylinder, the image projected onto the paper is a Mercator projection. Where does the projection represent Earth best? Where is it worst? Your map would be most correct at the equator. The shapes and sizes of continents become more stretched out near the poles. Early sailors and navigators found the Mercator map useful because most explorations were located near the equator. Many world maps still use the Mercator projection. The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continents shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. In a Mercator projection, all compass directions are straight lines. This makes it a good type of map for navigation. The top of the map is north, the bottom is south, the left side is west and the right side is east. However, because it is a flat map of a curved surface, a straight line on the map is not the shortest distance between the two points it connects. ",
      "topic_T_0379": "Instead of a cylinder, you could wrap the flat paper into a cone. Conic map projections use a cone shape to better represent regions near the poles (Figure 2.17). Conic projections are best where the cone shape touches the globe. This is along a line of latitude, usually the equator. ",
      "topic_T_0380": "What if want to wrap a different approach? Lets say you dont want to wrap a flat piece of paper around a round object? You could put a flat piece of paper right on the area that you want to map. This type of map is called a gnomonic map projection (Figure 2.18). The paper only touches Earth at one point. The sizes and shapes of countries near that point are good. The poles are often mapped this way to avoid distortion. A gnomic projection is best for use over a small area. ",
      "topic_T_0381": "In 1963, Arthur Robinson made a map with more accurate sizes and shapes of land areas. He did this using mathematical formulas. The formulas could directly translate coordinates onto the map. This type of projection is shaped like an oval rather than a rectangle (Figure 2.19). Robinsons map is more accurate than a Mercator projection. The shapes and sizes of continents are closer to true. Robinsons map is best within 45 degrees of the equator. Distances along the equator and the lines parallel to it are true. However, the scales along each line of latitude are different. In 1988, the National Geographic Society began to use Robinsons projection for its world maps. Whatever map projection is used, maps help us find places and to be able to get from one place to another. So how do you find your location on a map? ",
      "topic_T_0382": "Most maps use a grid of lines to help you to find your location. This grid system is called a geographic coordinate system. Using this system you can define your location by two numbers, latitude and longitude. Both numbers are angles between your location, the center of Earth, and a reference line (Figure 2.20). ",
      "topic_T_0383": "Lines of latitude circle around Earth. The equator is a line of latitude right in the middle of the planet. The equator is an equal distance from both the North and South Pole. If you know your latitude, you know how far you are north or south of the equator. ",
      "topic_T_0384": "Lines of longitude are circles that go around Earth from pole to pole, like the sections of an orange. Lines of longitude start at the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian is a circle that runs north to south and passes through Greenwich, England. Longitude tells you how far you are east or west from the Prime Meridian (Figure 2.21). You can remember latitude and longitude by doing jumping jacks. When your hands are above your head and your feet are together, say longitude (your body is long!). When you put your arms out to the side horizontally, say latitude (your head and arms make a cross, like the t in latitude). While you are jumping, your arms are going the same way as each of these grid lines: horizontal for latitude and vertical for longitude. ",
      "topic_T_0385": "If you know the latitude and longitude of a place, you can find it on a map. Simply place one finger on the latitude on the vertical axis of the map. Place your other finger on the longitude along the horizontal axis of the map. Move your fingers along the latitude and longitude lines until they meet. For example, say the location you want to find is at 30o N and 90o W. Place your right finger along 30o N at the right of the map. Place your left finger along the bottom at 90o W. Move your fingers along the lines until they meet. Your location should be near New Orleans, Louisiana, along the Gulf coast of the United States. What if you want to know the latitude and longitude of your location? If you know where you are on a map, point to the place with your fingers. Take one finger and move it along the latitude line to find your latitude. Then move another finger along the longitude line to find your and longitude. ",
      "topic_T_0386": "You can also use a polar coordinate system. Your location is marked by an angle and distance from some reference point. The angle is usually the angle between your location, the reference point, and a line pointing north. The distance is given in meters or kilometers. To find your location or to move from place to place, you need a map, a compass, and some way to measure your distance, such as a range finder. Suppose you need to go from your location to a marker that is 20o E and 500 m from your current position. You must do the following: Use the compass and compass rose on the map to orient your map with north. Use the compass to find which direction is 20o E. Walk 500 meters in that direction to reach your destination. Polar coordinates are used in a sport called orienteering. People who do orienteering use a compass and a map with polar coordinates. Participants find their way along a course across wilderness terrain (Figure 2.22). They move to various checkpoints along the course. The winner is the person who completes the course in the fastest time. ",
      "topic_T_0387": "Earth is a sphere and so is a globe. A globe is the best way to make a map of the whole Earth. Because both the planet and a globe have curved surfaces, the sizes and shapes of countries are not distorted. Distances are true to scale. (Figure 2.23). Globes usually have a geographic coordinate system and a scale. The shortest distance between two points on a globe is the length of the portion of a circle that connects them. Globes are difficult to make and carry around. They also cannot be enlarged to show the details of any particular area. Globes are best sitting on your desk for reference. Google Earth is a neat site to download to your computer. This is a link that you can follow to get there: http://w tilt your image and lots more. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "4. Use Figure 2.24. In what country are you located, if your coordinates are 60o N and 120o W? 5. Which of the following map projections gives you the least distortion around the poles? Mercator projection map Robinson projection map Conic projection ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "Maps can convey a lot of different types of information. They can tell you where you are or they can tell you something about a location. Earth scientists often use maps that have coordinates so that they can locate themselves or the features they are interested in. Different types of maps show different things well. For example, some types of maps show the tropical areas really well but do a terrible job depicting the polar regions. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "Describe what information a map can convey.\nIdentify some major types of map projections. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.\nDiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of globes.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Maps and globes are models of Earths surface. There are many ways to project the three-dimensional surface of Earth on to a flat map. Each type of map has some advantages as well as disadvantages. Most maps use a geographic coordinate system to help you find your location using latitude and longitude. Globes are the most accurate representations, because they are round like Earth, but they cannot be carried around easily. Globes also cannot show the details of Earths surface that maps can. ",
      "adjunct_Points to Consider": "How does a flight between two cities drawn on a globe compare with the same flight drawn on a map? How do people doing orienteering follow directions across wild terrain? Latitude and longitude give your location in two dimensions. How do you give your location in three dimensions? What is that third dimension? ",

      "topic_T_2028": "Like all chordates, vertebrates are animals with four defining traits, at least during the embryonic stage. The four traits are: a notochord; a dorsal hollow nerve cord; a post-anal tail; and pharyngeal slits. Some invertebrates also have these traits and are classified as chordates. What traits do vertebrates have that set them apart from invertebrate chordates? ",
      "topic_T_2029": "The main trait that sets vertebrates apart from invertebrate chordates is their vertebral column, or backbone. It develops from the notochord after the embryonic stage. As you can see in Figure 13.2 the vertebral column runs from head to tail along the dorsal (top) side of the body. The vertebral column is made up of repeating units of bone called vertebrae (vertebra, singular). The vertebral column helps the vertebrate body hold its shape. It also protects the spinal (nerve) cord that runs through it. ",
      "topic_T_2030": "The vertebral column is the core of the vertebrate endoskeleton, or internal skeleton. You can see a human skeleton as an example of the vertebrate endoskeleton in Figure 13.3. In addition to the vertebral column, the vertebrate endoskeleton includes: a cranium, or bony skull, that encloses and protects the brain; two pairs of limbs (in humans, arms and legs); limb girdles that connect the limbs to the rest of the endoskeleton (in humans, shoulders and hips). ",
      "topic_T_2031": "The vertebrate endoskeleton is made of bone and cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that contains a protein called collagen. Bone is a hard tissue consisting of a collagen framework that is filled in with minerals such as calcium. Bone is less flexible than cartilage but stronger. A bony endoskeleton allows an animal to grow larger and heavier than a cartilage endoskeleton would. Bone also provides more protection for soft tissues and internal organs. ",
      "topic_T_2032": "Most vertebrates share several other traits. The majority of vertebrates have: scales, feathers, fur, or hair covering their skin; muscles attached to the endoskeleton to allow movement; a circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood through a closed network of blood vessels; an excretory system that includes a pair of kidneys for filtering wastes out of the blood; a central nervous system with a brain, spinal cord, and nerve fibers throughout the body; an adaptive immune system that learns to recognize specific pathogens and launch tailor-made attacks against them; and an endocrine system with glands that secrete chemical messenger molecules called hormones. ",
      "topic_T_2033": "Vertebrates reproduce sexually. Most have separate male and female sexes. Vertebrates have one of three reproduc- tive strategies: ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary. Ovipary refers to the development of an embryo within an egg outside the mothers body. This occurs in most fish, amphibians, and reptiles. It also occurs in all birds. Ovovivipary refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mothers body. The egg remains inside the mothers body until it hatches, but the mother provides no nourishment to the developing embryo inside the egg. This occurs in some species of fish and reptiles. Vivipary refers to the development and nourishment of an embryo within the mothers body but not inside an egg. Birth may be followed by a period of parental care of the offspring. This reproductive strategy occurs in almost all mammals including humans. ",
      "topic_T_2034": "There are about 50,000 living species of vertebrates. They are placed in nine different classes. Table 13.1 lists these vertebrate classes and some of their traits. Five of the classes are fish. The other four classes are amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Class Hagfish Distinguishing Traits They have a cranium but no back- bone; they do not have jaws; their endoskeleton is made of cartilage; they are ectothermic. Example hagfish Class Lampreys Distinguishing Traits They have a partial backbone; they do not have jaws; their endoskele- ton is made of cartilage; they are ectothermic. Example lamprey Cartilaginous Fish They have a complete backbone; they have jaws; their endoskeleton is made of cartilage; they are ec- tothermic. shark Ray-Finned Fish They have a backbone and jaws; their endoskeleton is made of bones; they have thin, bony fins; they are ectothermic. perch Lobe-Finned Fish They have a backbone and jaws; their endoskeleton is made of bones; they have thick, fleshy fins; they are ectothermic. coelacanth Amphibians They have a bony endoskeleton with a backbone and jaws; they have gills as larvae and lungs as adults; they have four limbs; they are ectothermic frog Reptiles They have a bony endoskeleton with a backbone and jaws; they breathe only with lungs; they have four limbs; their skin is covered with scales; they have amniotic eggs; they are ectothermic. alligator Class Birds Distinguishing Traits They have a bony endoskeleton with a backbone but no jaws; they breathe only with lungs; they have four limbs, with the two front limbs modified as wings; their skin is cov- ered with feathers; they have amni- otic eggs; they are endothermic. Example bird Mammals They have a bony endoskeleton with a backbone and jaws; they breathe only with lungs; they have four limbs; their skin is covered with hair or fur; they have am- niotic eggs; they have mammary (milk-producing) glands; they are endothermic. bear ",
      "topic_T_2035": "The earliest vertebrates were jawless fish. They evolved about 550 million years ago. They were probably similar to modern hagfish (see Table 13.1). The tree diagram in Figure 13.4 summarizes how vertebrates evolved from that time forward. ",
      "topic_T_2036": "The earliest fish had an endoskeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. They also lacked a complete vertebral column. The first fish with a complete vertebral column evolved about 450 million years ago. These fish had jaws. They may have been similar to living sharks. About 400 million years ago, the first fish with a bony endoskeleton evolved. A bony skeleton could support a bigger body. Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned fish and lobe-finned fish. ",
      "topic_T_2037": "The earliest amphibians evolved from a lobe-finned fish ancestor. This occurred about 365 million years ago. Amphibians were the first terrestrial vertebrates. They lived on land as adults, but they had to return to the water to reproduce. The earliest reptiles evolved from an amphibian ancestor. This occurred at least 300 million years ago. Reptiles were the first vertebrates that did not need water to reproduce. Thats because they laid waterproof amniotic eggs. These eggs allowed the embryo inside to breathe without drying out. Mammals and birds both evolved from reptile-like ancestors. The first mammals appeared about 200 million years ago. The earliest birds evolved about 150 million years ago. ",
      "topic_T_2038": "Early vertebrates were ectothermic. Ectothermy means controlling body temperature to just a limited extent from the outside by changing behavior. For example, an ectotherm might stay in the shade to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. On a cold day, an ectotherm might bask in the sun to warm up, like the snake in Figure 13.5. Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. They can raise or lower their body temperature by their behavior but not by very much. In cold weather, an ectotherm cools down. As its body temperature drops, its metabolism slows down and it becomes inactive. Both mammals and birds evolved endothermy. Endothermy means controlling body temperature within a narrow range from the inside through biochemical or physical means. For example, on a cold day, an endotherm may produce more body heat by increasing its rate of metabolism. On a hot day, it may give off more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. That way, some of the heat can radiate into the air from the bodys surface. Endothermy requires more energy (and food) than ectothermy. However, it allows the animal to stay active regardless of the temperature outside. You can learn more about how vertebrates regulate their temperature by watching this video:  . ",

      "topic_T_2593": "Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived during earlier ages. Remains that become fossils are generally the hard parts of organismsmainly bones, teeth, or shells. Traces include any evidence of life, such as footprints like the dinosaur footprint in Figure 7.7. Fossils are like a window into the past. They provide direct evidence of what life was like long ago. A scientist who studies fossils to learn about the evolution of living things is called a paleontologist. ",
      "topic_T_2594": "The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly after death. Thats why most fossils consist of hard parts such as bones. Its rare even for hard parts to remain intact long enough to become fossils. Fossils form when water seeps through the remains and deposits minerals in them. The remains literally turn to stone. Remains are more likely to form fossils if they are covered quickly by sediments. Once in a while, remains are preserved almost unchanged. For example, they may be frozen in glaciers. Or they may be trapped in tree resin that hardens to form amber. Thats what happened to the wasp in Figure 7.8. The wasp lived about 20 million years ago, but even its fragile wings have been preserved by the amber. ",
      "topic_T_2595": "Fossils are useful for reconstructing the past only if they can be dated. Scientists need to determine when the organisms lived who left behind the fossils. Fossils can be dated in two different ways: absolute dating and relative dating. Absolute dating determines about how long ago a fossil organism lived. This gives the fossil an approximate age in years. Absolute dating is often based on the amount of carbon-14 or other radioactive element that remains in a fossil. You can learn how carbon-14 dating works by watching this short video: Relative dating determines which of two fossils is older or younger than the other but not their age in years. Relative dating is based on the positions of fossils in rock layers. Lower rock layers were laid down earlier, so they are assumed to contain older fossils. This is illustrated in Figure 7.9. ",
      "topic_T_2596": "The evolution of whales is a good example of how fossils can help us understand evolution. Scientists have long known that mammals first evolved on land about 200 million years ago. Its been a mystery, however, how whales evolved. Whales are mammals that live completely in the water. Did they evolve from earlier land mammals? Or did they evolve from animals that already lived in the water? Starting in the late 1970s, a growing number of fossils have allowed scientists to piece together the story of whale evolution. The fossils represent ancient, whale-like animals. They show that an ancient land mammal made its way back to the sea more than 50 million years ago. It became the ancestor of modern whales. In doing so, it lost its legs and became adapted to life in the water. In Figure 7.10 you can see an artists rendition of such a whale ancestor. It had legs and could walk on land, but it was also a good swimmer. Watch this short video to learn more about the amazing story of whale evolution based on the fossils: ",
      "topic_T_2597": "Scientists have learned a lot about evolution by comparing living organisms. They have compared body parts, embryos, and molecules such as DNA and proteins. ",
      "topic_T_2598": "Comparing body parts of different species may reveal evidence for evolution. For example, all mammals have front limbs that look quite different and are used for different purposes. Bats use their front limbs to fly, whales use them to swim, and cats use them to run and climb. However, the front limbs of all three animalsas well as humanshave the same basic underlying bone structure. You can see this in Figure 7.11. The similar bones provide evidence that all four animals evolved from a common ancestor. ",
      "topic_T_2599": "Some of the most interesting evidence for evolution comes from vestigial structures. These are body parts that are no longer used but are still present in modern organisms. Examples in humans include tail bones and the appendix. Human beings obviously dont have tails, but our ancestors did. We still have bones at the base of our spine that form a tail in other, related animals, such as monkeys. The appendix is a tiny remnant of a once-larger organ. In a distant ancestor, it was needed to digest food. If your appendix becomes infected, a surgeon can remove it. You wont miss it because it no longer has any purpose in the human body. ",
      "topic_T_2600": "An embryo is an organism in the earliest stages of development. Embryos of different species may look quite similar, even when the adult forms look very different. Look at the drawings of embryos in Figure 7.12. They represent very early life stages of a chicken, turtle, pig, and human being. The embryos look so similar that its hard to tell them apart. Such similarities provide evidence that all four types of animals are related. They help document that evolution has occurred. ",
      "topic_T_2601": "Scientists can compare the DNA or proteins of different species. If the molecules are similar, this shows that the species are related. The more similar the molecules are, the closer the relationship is likely to be. When molecules are used in this way, they are called molecular clocks. This method assumes that random mutations occur at a constant rate for a given protein or segment of DNA. Over time, the mutations add up. The longer the amount of time since species diverged, the more differences there will be in their DNA or proteins. Table 7.1 compares the DNA of four different organisms with modern human DNA. The DNA of chimpanzees is almost 99 percent the same as the DNA of modern humans. This shows that chimpanzees are very closely related to us. We are less closely related to the other organisms in the table. Its no surprise that grapes, which are plants, are less like us than the animals in the table. Organism Chimpanzee Cow Chicken Honeybee Grape Similarity with Human DNA (percent the same) 98.8 85 65 44 24 ",
      "topic_T_2602": "The best evidence for evolution comes from actually observing changes in organisms through time. In the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galpagos Islands to do fieldwork. They wanted to re-study Darwins finches. They spent the next 40 years on the project. Their hard work paid off. They were able to document evolution by natural selection taking place in the finches. A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "3. Apply the molecular clock concept to the data in the table below. Explain which of the three species in the table shared the most recent common ancestor with the human species. Species African gorilla Orangutan Rhesus monkey Percent of DNA that is the Same as Human DNA 98.4 97 93 4. ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "In his book On the Origin of Species, Darwin included a lot of evidence for evolution. Since then, much more evidence has accumulated. The evidence includes millions of fossils, like the one in Figure 7.6. It also includes detailed knowledge of living organisms. ",
      "adjunct_Lesson Objectives": "Explain what fossils are, how they form, and how they are dated.\nIdentify evidence for evolution provided by living organisms.\nDescribe recent evolution by natural selection in Darwins finches.\n",
      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived long ago. They form mainly when minerals in water turn remains to stone. Fossils can be dated using methods such as carbon-14 dating or their positions in rock layers. Scientists have learned a lot about evolution from species that are living today. They have compared body parts, vestigial organs, embryos, and molecules in different species. Species that are the most similar in these ways are generally the most closely related. The best evidence for evolution is seeing it in action. An example is the work of Peter and Rosemary Grant. They documented recent evolution by natural selection in Darwins finches. ",
      "adjunct_Points to Consider": "Understanding how evolution occurs requires knowledge of genetics. How is variation in traits within a species related to genes? How would you define evolution in genetic terms? ",
      "adjunct_Recall": "1. Describe how fossils usually form. 2. What are vestigial structures? Give an example. ",
      "adjunct_Think Critically": "4. Compare and contrast relative and absolute dating. 5. How did scientists use fossils to solve the mystery of whale evolution? 6. Explain why Peter and Rosemary Grant were eyewitnesses to evolution. "

      "topic_T_0537": "The Sun is made almost entirely of the elements hydrogen and helium. The Sun has no solid material. Most atoms in the Sun exist as plasma. Plasma is superheated gas with an electrical charge. Because the Sun is made of gases, it does not have a defined outer boundary. Like Earth, the Sun has an internal structure. The inner three layers make up what we would actually call the Sun. ",
      "topic_T_0538": "The core is the Suns innermost layer. The core is plasma. It has a temperature of around 15 million degrees Celsius (C). Nuclear fusion reactions create the immense temperature. In these reactions, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium. This releases vast amounts of energy. The energy moves towards the outer layers of the Sun. Energy from the Suns core powers most of the solar system. ",
      "topic_T_0539": "The radiative zone is the next layer out. It has a temperature of about 4 million degrees C. Energy from the core travels through the radiative zone. The rate the energy travels is extremely slow. Light particles, called photons, can only travel a few millimeters before they hit another particle. The particles are absorbed and then released again. It may take 50 million years for a photon to travel all the way through the radiative zone. ",
      "topic_T_0540": "The convection zone surrounds the radiative zone. In the convection zone, hot material from near the Suns center rises. This material cools at the surface, and then plunges back downward. The material then receives more heat from the radiative zone. ",
      "topic_T_0541": "The three outer layers of the Sun are its atmosphere. ",
      "topic_T_0542": "The photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun (Figure 24.17). Its the part that we see shining. Surprisingly, the photosphere is also one of the coolest layers of the Sun. It is only about 6000 degrees C. ",
      "topic_T_0543": "The chromosphere lies above the photosphere. It is about 2,000 km thick. The thin chromosphere is heated by energy from the photosphere. Temperatures range from about 4000 degrees C to about 10,000 degrees C. The chromosphere is not as hot as other parts of the Sun, and it glows red. Jets of gas sometimes fly up through the chromosphere. With speeds up to 72,000 km per hour, the jets can fly as high as 10,000 kilometers. ",
      "topic_T_0544": "The corona is the outermost part of the Suns atmosphere. It is the Suns halo, or crown. With a temperature of 1 to 3 million K, the corona is much hotter than the photosphere. The corona extends millions of kilometers into space. Sometime you should try to see a total solar eclipse. If you do you will see the Suns corona shining out into space. ",
      "topic_T_0545": "The Sun has many incredible surface features. Dont try to look at them though! Looking directly at the Sun can cause blindness. Find the appropriate filters for a pair of binoculars or a telescope and enjoy! ",
      "topic_T_0546": "The most noticeable magnetic activity of the Sun is the appearance of sunspots. Sunspots are cooler, darker areas on the Suns surface (Figure 24.18). Sunspots occur in an 11 year cycle. The number of sunspots begins at a minimum. The number gradually increases to the maximum. Then the number returns to a minimum again. Sunspots form because loops of the Suns magnetic field break through the surface. Sunspots usually occur in pairs. The loop breaks through the surface where it comes out of the Sun. It breaks through again where it goes back into the Sun. Sunspots disrupt the transfer of heat from the Suns lower layers. ",
      "topic_T_0547": "A loop of the Suns magnetic field may break. This creates solar flares. Solar flares are violent explosions that release huge amounts of energy (Figure 24.19). The streams of high energy particles they emit make up the solar wind. Solar wind is dangerous to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar flares can even cause damage on Earth. They have knocked out entire power grids and can disturb radio, satellite, and cell phone communications. ",
      "topic_T_0548": "Another amazing feature on the Sun is solar prominences. Plasma flows along the loop that connects sunspots. This plasma forms a glowing arch. The arch is a solar prominence. Solar prominences can reach thousands of kilometers into the Suns atmosphere. Prominences can last for a day to several months. Prominences can be seen during a total solar eclipse. NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on February 11, 2010. SDO is studying the Suns magnetic field. This includes how the Sun affects Earths atmosphere and climate. SDO provides extremely high resolution images. The craft gathers data faster than anything that ever studied the Sun.

      "adjunct_Introduction": "Our Sun is a star. This star provides light and heat and supports almost all life on Earth. The Sun is the center of the solar system. It is by far the largest part of the solar system. Added together, all of the planets make up just 0.2 percent of the solar systems mass. The Sun makes up the remaining 99.8 percent of all the mass in the solar system (Figure 24.16)! ",

      "adjunct_Lesson Summary": "The mass of the Sun is 99.8% of the mass of our solar system. The Sun is mostly hydrogen with smaller amounts of helium. The material is in the form of plasma. The main part of the Sun has three layers: the core, the radiative zone and the convection zone. The Suns atmosphere also has three layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona. Nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the core of the Sun produces tremendous amounts of energy that radiate out from the Sun. Some features of the Suns surface include sunspots, solar flares, and prominences. ",

      "topic_T_2127": "From the outside, the skin looks plain and simple, as you can see in Figure 16.5. But at a cellular level, theres nothing plain or simple about it. A single square inch of skin contains about 20 blood vessels, hundreds of sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings. It also contains tens of thousands of pigment-producing cells. Clearly, there is much more to skin than meets the eye! For a dramatic introduction to the skin, watch this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The skin is only about 2 mm thick, or about as thick as the cover of a book. Although it is very thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called the epidermis and the dermis. You can see both layers and some of their structures in Figure 16.6. Refer to the figure as you read about the epidermis and dermis below. ",
      "topic_T_2128": "The epidermis is the outer layer of skin. It consists almost entirely of epithelial cells. There are no blood vessels, nerve endings, or glands in this skin layer. Nonetheless, this layer of skin is very active. It is constantly being renewed. How does this happen? 1. The cells at the bottom of the epidermis are always dividing by mitosis to form new cells. 2. The new cells gradually move up through the epidermis toward the surface of the body. As they move, they produce the tough, fibrous protein called keratin. 3. By the time the cells reach the surface, they have filled with keratin and died. On the surface, the dead cells form a protective, waterproof layer. 4. Dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the epidermis. As they are shed, they are replaced by other dead cells that move up from below. The epidermis also contains cells called melanocytes. You can see a melanocyte in Figure 16.7. Melanocytes produce melanin. Melanin is a brown pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyones skin has about the same number of melanocytes per square inch. However, the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin that is produced depends partly on your genes and partly on how much ultraviolet light strikes your skin. The more light you get, the more melanin your melanocytes produce. This explains why skin tans when its exposed to sunlight. ",
      "topic_T_2129": "The dermis is the inner layer of skin. It is made of tough connective tissue. The dermis is attached to the epidermis by fibers made of the protein collagen. The dermis is where most skin structures are located. Look again at Figure pain, pressure, and temperature. If you cut your skin and it bleeds, the cut has penetrated the dermis and damaged a blood vessel. The cut probably hurts as well because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. You can see some of these structures in Figure 16.8. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface. Sebaceous glands are commonly called oil glands. They produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles. Then it makes its way along the hair shaft to the surface of the skin. Sebum waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out. Sweat glands produce the salty fluid known as sweat. Sweat contains excess water, salts, and other waste products. Each sweat gland has a duct that passes through the epidermis. Sweat travels from the gland through the duct and out through a pore on the surface of the skin. ",
      "topic_T_2130": "You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. In several ways, it helps maintain homeostasis. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. Melanin in the epidermis absorbs ultraviolet light. This prevents the light from reaching and damaging the dermis. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, increasing blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface and radiate into the environment. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, decreasing blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface so less heat is lost to the environment. ",
      "topic_T_2131": "What can you do to keep your skin healthy? The most important step you can take is to protect your skin from sun exposure. On sunny days, wear long sleeves and pants and a hat with a brim. Also apply sunscreen to exposed areas of skin. Protecting your skin in these ways will reduce damage to your skin by ultraviolet light. This is important because skin that has been damaged by ultraviolet light is at greater risk of developing skin cancer. This is true whether the damage is due to sunlight or the light in tanning beds. About 85 percent of teens develop acne, like the boy in Figure 16.9. Acne is a condition in which pimples form on the skin. It is caused by a bacterial infection. It happens when the sebaceous glands secrete too much sebum. The excess oil provides a good place for bacteria to grow. Keeping the skin clean helps prevent acne. Over-the-counter products or prescription drugs may be needed if the problem is serious or doesnt clear up on its own. ",
      "topic_T_2132": "You may spend a lot of time and money on your hair and nails. You may think of them as accessories, like clothes or jewelry. However, like the skin, the hair and nails also play important roles in helping the body maintain homeostasis. ",
      "topic_T_2133": "Only mammals have hair. Hair is a fiber made mainly of the tough protein keratin. The cells of each hair are filled with keratin and no longer alive. The dead cells overlap each other, almost like shingles on a roof. They work like shingles as well, by helping shed water from hair. Head hair helps protect the scalp from sun exposure. It also helps insulate the body. It traps air so heat cant escape from the head. Hair in eyelashes and eyebrows helps keep water and dust out of the eyes. Hairs inside the nostrils of the nose trap dust and germs in the air so they cant reach the lungs. ",
      "topic_T_2134": "Fingernails and toenails are made of specialized cells that grow out of the epidermis. They too are filled with keratin. The keratin makes them tough and hard. Their job is to protect the ends of the fingers and toes. They also make it easier to feel things with the sensitive fingertips by acting as a counterforce when things are handled. ",
      "adjunct_Apply Concepts": "5. Why does it usually hurt to cut the skin but not the hair or nails? ",
      "adjunct_Introduction": "The skin is the major organ of the integumentary system. Hair and nails are also part of this organ system. All three organs provide a protective covering for the body.

The skin consists of two distinct layers, an outer layer called the epidermis and an inner layer called the dermis. The epidermis is constantly being renewed as dead cells on the surface are shed. This layer contains melanin- producing melanocytes. The dermis contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands. The skin prevents loss of water from the body and keeps out microorganisms. Melanin in the epidermis protects the dermis from damaging ultraviolet light.
