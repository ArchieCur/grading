Grade the following student response using the provided materials.\n\nQUESTION:\nA syncline is a fold that arches upward.\n\nANSWER CHOICES:\na. true\nb. false\n\nLESSON CONTEXT:\nTopic topic_T_0793: Stress is the force applied to a rock. There are four types of stresses: Confining stress happens as weight of all the overlying rock pushes down on a deeply buried rock. The rock is being pushed in from all sides, which compresses it. The rock will not deform because there is no place for it to move. Compression stress squeezes rocks together. Compression causes rocks to fold or fracture (Figure 7.1). When two cars collide, compression causes them to crumple. Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries. Tension stress pulls rocks apart. Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress found at divergent plate boundaries. Shear stress happens when forces slide past each other in opposite directions (Figure 7.2). This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries. The amount of stress on a rock may be greater than the rocks strength. In that case, the rock will change and deform (Figure 7.3). Deep within the Earth, the pressure is very great. A rock behaves like a stretched rubber band. When the stress stops, the rock goes back to its original shape. If more stress is applied to the rock, it bends and flows. It does not return to its original shape. Near the surface, if the stress continues, the rock will fracture and break. \n\nTopic topic_T_0795: Deep within the Earth, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds. You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers. In the Figure 7.6, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are folded, they do not return to their original shape. There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines. A monocline is a simple one step bend in the rock layers (Figure 7.7). In a monocline, the oldest rocks are still at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold (Figure 7.8). The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center. A syncline is a fold that bends downward (Figure 7.9). In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center. The oldest rocks are at the outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin. If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin. \n\nVocabulary: fold: the point under Earths surface where rocks rupture during an earthquake cloud that forms on the ground a bend in a set of rocks caused by compression ; syncline: \n\nSAMPLE SOLUTION:\nThe correct answer is 'b: false'\n\nReasoning: Based on the lesson content, false because the material explains relevant concepts.\n\nEVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nEvaluate the student's answer using these criteria:\n1.

The main cause of tides is the pull of the Moons gravity on Earth. The pull is greatest on whatever is closest to the Moon. Although the gravity pulls the land, only the water can move. As a result: Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon is pulled hardest by the Moons gravity. This causes a bulge of water on that side of Earth. That bulge is a high tide. Earth itself is pulled harder by the Moons gravity than is the ocean on the side of Earth opposite the Moon. As a result, there is bulge of water on the opposite side of Earth. This creates another high tide. With water bulging on two sides of Earth, theres less water left in between. This creates low tides on the other two sides of the planet. \n\nTopic topic_T_0176: The Suns gravity also pulls on Earth and its oceans. Even though the Sun is much larger than the Moon, the pull of the Suns gravity is much less because the Sun is much farther away. The Suns gravity strengthens or weakens the Moons influence on tides. Figure 14.14 shows the position of the Moon relative to the Sun at different times during the month. The positions of the Moon and Sun relative to each other determines how the Sun affects tides. This creates spring tides or neap tides. Spring tides occur during the new moon and full moon. The Sun and Moon are in a straight line either on the same side of Earth or on opposite sides. Their gravitational pull combines to cause very high and very low tides. Spring tides have the greatest tidal range. Neap tides occur during the first and third quarters of the Moon. The Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other. Their gravity pulls on the oceans in different directions so the highs and lows are not as great. Neap tides have the smallest tidal range. This animation shows the effect of the Moon and Sun on the tides: \n\nVocabulary: tide: \n\nSAMPLE SOLUTION:\nThe correct answer is 'b: false'\n\nReasoning: Based on the lesson content, false because the material explains relevant concepts.\n\nEVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nEvaluate the student's answer using these criteria:\n1.

They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. An exchange pool is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. \n\nTopic topic_T_2408: Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. Watch this video for an excellent visual introduction to the water cycle:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: \n\nTopic topic_T_2409: Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. \n\nVocabulary: water cycle: biogeochemical cycle in which water passes back and forth between the ocean, ground, atmosphere, and organisms \n\nSAMPLE SOLUTION:\nThe correct answer is 'd: decomposition.'\n\nReasoning: Based on the lesson content, decomposition. because the material explains relevant concepts.\n\nEVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nEvaluate the student's answer using these criteria:\n1.

It consists mainly of cardiac muscle tissue. It pumps blood by repeated, rhythmic contractions. This produces the familiar lub-dub sound of each heartbeat. For a good video introduction to the heart and how it works, watch this entertaining Bill Nye video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: \n\nTopic topic_T_2194: The heart has four chambers, or rooms, which you can see in Figure 18.3. Each chamber is an empty space with muscular walls through which blood can flow. The top two chambers of the heart are called the left and right atria (atrium, singular). The atria of the heart receive blood from the body or lungs and pump it into the bottom chambers of the heart. The bottom two chambers of the heart are called the left and right ventricles. The ventricles receive blood from the atria and pump it out of the heart, either to the lungs or to the rest of the body. Flaps of tissue called valves separate the hearts chambers. Valves keep blood flowing in just one direction through the heart. For example, a valve at the bottom of the right atrium opens to let blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Then the valve closes so the blood cant flow back into the right atrium. \n\nTopic topic_T_2195: Blood flows through the heart in two paths. Trace these two paths in Figure 18.4 as you read about them below. You can also learn about how blood flows through the heart with this rap:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  1. One path of blood in the heart is through the right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium receives oxygen- poor blood from the body. It pumps the blood into the right ventricle. Then the right ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart to the lungs. This path through the heart is part of the pulmonary circulation. 2. The other path of blood in the heart is through the left atrium and left ventricle. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. It pumps the blood into the left ventricle. Then the left ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. This path through the heart is part of the systemic circulation. \n\nVocabulary: blood vessel: long, tube-like organ that forms part of the complex network of vessels that run through the body and transport blood to all the bodys cells \n\nSAMPLE SOLUTION:\nThe correct answer is 'b: arteries.'\n\nReasoning: Based on the lesson content, arteries. because the material explains relevant concepts.\n\nEVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nEvaluate the student's answer using these criteria:\n1.
